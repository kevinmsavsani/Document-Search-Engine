===Workflow Management and Semantic Web Services===
In the early 1990s, he initiated research in the formal modeling, scheduling, and correctness of workflows. His METEOR project demonstrated the value of research with real-world applications; its tools were used in graduate courses in several countries, and its technology was licensed to create a commercial product.

The follow-on METEOR-S project has been highly influential. He led the research (later joined by [[IBM]]) that resulted in the [[W3C]] submission of WSDL-S (Semantic Annotation of [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]), the basis for [[SAWSDL]], a [[W3C recommendation]] for adding semantics to [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]].
