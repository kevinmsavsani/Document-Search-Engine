'''Arthur Richard Newton''' ([[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], 1 July 1951 &ndash; 2 January 2007) was the dean of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]. 

Newton was educated at the [[University of Melbourne]] and received a [[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]] in 1973 and [[Master's degree|M.Eng.Sci]] in 1975.  He worked at Berkeley from 1975 on [[SPICE]] (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis), developed initially by Larry Nagel and [[Donald Pederson]] to analyze and design complex electronic circuitry with speed and accuracy. It is claimed that nearly all electronic chips now use SPICE or a derivative.

University of California, Berkeley awarded Newton a [[Ph.D]] in 1978 and he was appointed to the Engineering Faculty a few months later.  He was appointed assistant professor in 1978, associate professor in 1982 and full professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences in 1985.  He chaired of department from 1999 to 2000, and was dean of the College of Engineering and the Roy W. Carlson Professor of Engineering from 2000 until his death.
