The '''American Revolution''' was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] in [[North America]] joined together to break free from the [[British Empire]], combining to become the [[United States|United States of America]]. They first rejected the authority of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a [[Provincial Congress]], or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual self-governing [[State (polity)|states]]. The British responded by sending combat troops to re-impose direct rule. Through representatives sent in 1775 to the [[Second Continental Congress]], the new states joined together at first to defend their respective [[self-governance]] and manage the armed conflict against the British known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83, also ''American War of Independence''). Ultimately, the states collectively determined that the British monarchy, by acts of [[tyrant|tyranny]], could no longer [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimately]] claim their [[allegiance]]. They then severed ties with the British Empire in July 1776, when the Congress issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], rejecting the monarchy on behalf of the new [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] nation. The war ended with effective American victory in October 1781, followed by formal British abandonment of any claims to the United States with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783.

The American Revolution was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in early American society and government, collectively referred to as the ''[[American Enlightenment]]''. Americans rejected the [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]] common in [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Europe at the time, championing instead the development of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] understanding of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government [[Consent of the governed|responsible to the will of the people]]. However, sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of [[democracy]] desirable in the new government, with a number of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] fearing [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].


==Origins==
[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.jpg|thumb|alt=Before the revolution: the thirteen colonies are in pink|Before the Revolution: The [[Thirteen Colonies]] are in pink]]
The American Revolution was predicated by a number of ideas and events that, combined, led to a political and social separation of colonial possessions from the home nation and a coalescing of those former individual colonies into an independent nation.

===Summary===

====Ideology behind the Revolution====
[[File:commonsense.jpg|thumb|alt=Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, published in 1776|[[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', published in 1776]]
{{Main|American Enlightenment|Liberalism in the United States|Republicanism in the United States|Freedom of religion in the United States}}
{{See|A Summary View of the Rights of British America|Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania|Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms}}

The ideological movement known as the American Enlightenment was a critical precursor to the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of liberalism, democracy, republicanism, and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. Collectively, the belief in these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.







===Controversial British legislation===
The Revolution was in some ways incited by a number of pieces of legislation originating from the British Parliament that, for Americans, were illegitimate acts of a government that had no right to pass laws on Englishmen in the Americas who did not have elected representation in that government. For the British, policy makers saw these laws as necessary to rein in colonial subjects who, in the name of economic development that was designed to benefit the home nation, had been allowed near-autonomy for too long.

{{Main|Sugar Act|Currency Act|Quartering Acts|Stamp Act 1765|Declaratory Act}}
{{See|No taxation without representation|Virtual representation}}



In 1764, Parliament enacted the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Currency Act]], further vexing the colonists. Protests led to a powerful new weapon, the systematic [[boycott]] of British goods. The following year, the British enacted the [[Quartering Acts]], which required British soldiers to be quartered at the expense of residents in certain areas. Colonists objected to this, as well.

In June 1772, in what became known as the [[Gaspée Affair|''Gaspée'' Affair]], a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations was burned by American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]]. Soon afterward, Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts reported that he and the royal judges would be paid directly from London, thus bypassing the colonial legislature.

In response to the ''Massachusetts Government Act'', Massachusetts and other colonies formed local governments called [[Provincial Congress]]es. In 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] convened, consisting of representatives from each of the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. Standing [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committees of Safety]] were created by each Provincial Congress or equivalent for the enforcement of the resolutions by the Committee of Correspondence, Provincial Congress, and the Continental Congress. British colonies in North America that did not have government responsible to its people did not join the Continental Congress, but remained loyal to the Crown. These colonies included [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Bermuda]], [[West Florida]] and [[East Florida]].

==Factions==
The population of the Thirteen Colonies was far from homogeneous, particularly in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely not only within regions and communities, but also within families and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution.

===King George III===

===Patriots===
{{Main|Patriot (American Revolution)}}
{{See|Sons of Liberty}}
At the time, revolutionaries were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans". They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens.

The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775, after the war had started. The Congress created the [[Continental Army]] and extended the [[Olive Branch Petition]] to the crown as an attempt at reconciliation. King George III refused to receive it, issuing instead the [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], requiring action against the "traitors".

In the winter of 1775, the Americans [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]]. General [[Richard Montgomery]] captured [[Montreal]] but a joint [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attack on Quebec]] with the help of [[Benedict Arnold]] failed.


===Prisoners===
{{Main|Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War}}
In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. The British government at first started treating captured rebel combatants as common criminals and preparations were made to bring them to trial for treason. American Secretary [[Lord Germain]] and First Lord of the Admiralty [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]] were especially eager to do so, with a particular emphasis on those who had previously served in British units (and thereby sworn an oath of allegiance to the crown).


==Finance==





==Creating new state constitutions==


The new states had to decide not only what form of government to create, they first had to decide how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. In states where the wealthy exerted firm control over the process, such as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], Virginia, [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], New York and Massachusetts, the results were constitutions that featured:
* [[Bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower;
* Strong [[governor]]s, with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority;
* Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government;
* The continuation of [[Established church|state-established religion]].
 [[File:Benjamin Rush Painting by Peale 1783.jpg|thumb|alt=Benjamin Rush, 1783|[[Benjamin Rush]], 1783]]
In states where the less affluent had organized sufficiently to have significant power—especially Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire—the resulting constitutions embodied
* universal white manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey enfranchised some property owning widows, a step that it retracted 25 years later);
* strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]];
* relatively weak governors, without veto powers, and little appointing authority;
* prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts;

{{See|New York and New Jersey campaign|Staten Island Peace Conference|Saratoga campaign|Philadelphia campaign}}


In 1777, as part of a grand strategy to end the war, the British sent an invasion force from Canada to seal off New England, which the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. In a major case of mis-coordination, the British army in New York City went to Philadelphia which it captured from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] waited in vain for reinforcements from New York, and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15 a pivotal [[siege]] at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania distracted British troops and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]].

===National debt===
{{See|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}}

The national debt after the American Revolution fell into three categories. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners—mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.
