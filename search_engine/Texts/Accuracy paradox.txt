The '''accuracy paradox''' for [[predictive analytics]] states that predictive models with a given level of [[accuracy]] may have greater [[predictive power]] than models with higher accuracy. It may be better to avoid the accuracy metric in favor of other metrics such as [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] and [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]].   

Accuracy is often the starting point for analyzing the quality of a predictive model, as well as an obvious criterion for prediction. Accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of cases evaluated. It may seem obvious that the ratio of correct predictions to cases should be a key metric. A predictive model may have high accuracy, but be useless.


where
: TN is the number of true negative cases
: FP is the number of false positive cases
: FN is the number of false negative cases
: TP is the number of true positive cases

Model improvements should not be measured in terms of accuracy gains. It may be going too far to say that accuracy is irrelevant, but caution is advised when using accuracy in the evaluation of predictive models.
