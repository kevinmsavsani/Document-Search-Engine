See [[asymptotic analysis]] and [[big O notation]] for the notation.

The most common type of asymptotic expansion is a power series in either positive
or negative powers. Methods of generating such expansions include the [[Euler–Maclaurin summation formula]] and
integral transforms such as the [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] and [[Mellin transform|Mellin]] transforms. Repeated integration by parts will often lead to an asymptotic expansion. 

Since a ''convergent'' [[Taylor series]] fits the definition of asymptotic expansion as


==Examples of asymptotic expansions==

* [[Gamma function]]


* [[Exponential integral]]


* [[Riemann zeta function]]


* [[Error function]]


==Detailed example==
Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence. Thus, for example, one may start with the ordinary series 




The integral on the left hand side, understood as a [[Cauchy principal value]], can be expressed
in terms of the [[exponential integral]].  The integral on the right hand side may be recognized as the
[[gamma function]]. Evaluating both, one obtains the asymptotic expansion
