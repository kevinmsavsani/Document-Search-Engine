Other members of the consortium included [[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Control Data Corporation]], [[Kubota]], [[NEC Corporation]], [[JFE Group|NKK]], [[Olivetti]], [[Prime Computer]], [[Pyramid Technology]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sony]], [[Sumitomo]], [[Tandem Computers]], [[Wang Laboratories]], and [[Zenith Data Systems]]. Besides these large companies, several [[start-up companies]] built ACE-compliant systems as well. 

The environment standardized on the [[MIPS architecture]] and two [[operating system]]s: [[SCO UNIX]] with [[Open Desktop]] and what would become [[Windows NT]] (originally named OS/2 3.0). The [[Advanced RISC Computing]] (ARC) document was produced to give hardware and firmware specifications for the platform. 

The porting of the Microsoft operating system to other [[instruction set architectures]] created hope that other hardware platforms could more effectively compete with [[Wintel]] [[Personal computer|PC]]s . The belief was that [[RISC]]-based computers would deliver superior price-performance to that of the older platform. Eventually, Windows NT was also ported to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] and [[PowerPC]] architectures as well. 

The initiative was used by microprocessor companies as an attempt to take market share away from Intel. System companies used the initiative as an attempt to take market share away from the [[workstation]] leader, [[Sun Microsystems]].

==Dissolution==
Even so, the ACE initiative (and consortium) began to fall apart little more than a year after it started, as it became apparent that there was not a mass market for an alternative to the [[Wintel]] computing platform. The upstart platforms did not offer enough performance improvement from the incumbent PC and there were major cost disadvantages of such systems due to the low volume production. When the initiative started, RISC based systems (running at 100-200 MHz at the time) had substantial performance advantage over [[Intel 80486]] and original [[Intel P5|Pentium]] chips (running at approximately 60 MHz at the time).{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} Intel quickly migrated the Pentium design to newer [[semiconductor]] process generations and that performance (and operating frequency) advantage slipped away.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

There were other potential conflicts: earlier that year, MIPS had been purchased by SGI, which may have also contributed to concerns about the neutrality of the target platform. DEC had released their Alpha processor and were less interested in promoting a competing architecture.  And finally, the significant improvements in Intel [[x86]] performance made abandoning it less attractive, and although ACE supported x86 for a time, Intel was never a member.
