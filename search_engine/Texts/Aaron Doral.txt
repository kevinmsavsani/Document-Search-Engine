'''Aaron Doral''' ('''Number Five''') is a [[fictional character]] from the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series.


Doral appears again on Cylon-occupied [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]] curiously monitoring the situation developing between Sharon and [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]]. He initially decides that Sharon cannot be trusted, and orders Number Six to deal with her. Once Doral discovers that Sharon is pregnant, he states the child is a miracle, and must be protected at all costs. The discovery also leads to his suggesting a major tactical change, although the details of this new plan, as well as whatever changes were made from the original, have as yet to be clearly defined in the series.

The Doral Cylons seem to act more covertly, having an unassuming "average" appearance in order to better blend in with more trivial background matters instead of taking more noticeable positions of authority and purpose. He seems to have a position of authority among the Cylons, acting as overseer, and having a hand behind their decision making and tactical planning. This personalization is contradicted, however, in the special TV movie "[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]," in which a copy of Cavil berates a confused Doral copy (wearing clothing nearly identical to the first copy encountered by the Colonials) for his lack of disguise and caution while wandering the halls of Galactica. A later scene shows a small group of Doral copies assigned to menial labor on occupied Caprica, doing work they complain is below them and should be handled by centurions. Likewise, in the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]," a copy of Doral can be seen serving drinks to other humanoid Cylons. These scenes seem to imply the Doral models are of lower intelligence than other Cylon models, and possess less authority.


In "[[Torn(Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]" a Number Eight accuses Doral of "barely even being able to say [God's] name."
