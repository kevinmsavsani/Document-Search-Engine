'''Avizo''' (pronounce: ‘a-VEE-zo’) is a general-purpose commercial software application for scientific and industrial [[data visualization]] and analysis.

Avizo is developed by '''VSG - Visualization Sciences Group''' and was originally designed and developed by the Visualization and Data Analysis Group at Zuse-Institute Berlin (ZIB) under the name amira. Avizo was commercially released in November 2007.

Avizo is a [[software application]] which enables users to perform [[interactive visualization]] and computation on 3D data sets.   
The Avizo interface is modelled on the [[visual programming]].  Users manipulate data and module components, organized in an interactive graph representation (called Pool), or in a [[Tree view]]. Data and modules can be interactively connected together, and controlled with several parameters, creating a visual processing network whose output is displayed in a 3D viewer.

With this interface, complex data can be interactively explored and analyzed by applying a controlled sequence of computation and display processes resulting into a meaningful visual representation and associated derived data.

== Features==
'''Data Import: '''
* Geometric models (such as point sets, line sets, surfaces, grids)
* Molecular data

Avizo is based on [[Open Inventor]] by VSG [[Computer graphics|3D Graphics]] [[SDK]].

==Applications==
Avizo has been designed to support different types of applications and workflows. 
It is a versatile and customizable [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] tool used in various application fields, such as:
*[[Scientific visualization]], physics, chemistry
*[[Astrophysics]]
