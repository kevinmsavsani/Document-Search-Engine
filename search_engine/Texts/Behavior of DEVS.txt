In addition, since the behaviors of a given DEVS model needs to define how the state transition change both when time is passed by and when an event occurs, it has been described by a much general formalism, called General System [[Behavior_of_DEVS#References|[ZPK00]]]. In this article, we use a sub-class of General System formalism, called [[Timed Event System]] instead. 

Depending on how to define the total state and its external state transition function of [[DEVS]], two ways to define the behavior of a [[DEVS]] model using [[Timed Event System]]. 
Since [[Behavior of Coupled DEVS|behavior of a Coupled DEVS]] model is defined as an [[DEVS#Atomic_DEVS|Atomic DEVS]] model, behavior of Coupled DEVS class is defined by [[Timed Event System]].

== View 1: Total States = States * Elapsed Times ==
Suppose that a [[DEVS]] model,


Then the [[DEVS]] model,


\Delta(q, \omega)= 
\begin{cases}
(\delta_{ext}(s,t_e,x), 0)& \textrm{if } ~s \in S\\
(illegal, t_e)& \textrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}

\Delta(q, \omega)= 
\begin{cases}
(\delta_{int}(s), 0)& \textrm{if } ~s \in S, t_e = ta(s), y = \lambda(s)\\
(illegal, t_e)& \textrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}

== View 2: Total States = States * Lifespans * Elapsed Times  ==
Suppose that a [[DEVS]] model,




\Delta(q, \omega)= 
\begin{cases}
(s', ta(s'), 0)& \textrm{if } ~s \in S, \delta_{ext}(s,t_s,t_e,x)=(s',1)\\
(s', t_s, t_e)& \textrm{if } ~s \in S, \delta_{ext}(s,t_s,t_e,x)=(s',0)\\
(s, t_s, t_e)& \textrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}

\Delta(q, \omega)= 
\begin{cases}
(s', ta(s'),0)& \textrm{if } ~s \in S, t_e = t_s, y = \lambda(s), \delta_{int}(s)=s'\\
(illegal, \infty, t_e)& \textrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
