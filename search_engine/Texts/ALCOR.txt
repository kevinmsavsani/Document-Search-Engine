In Europe, a high level machine architecture for [[ALGOL 60]] was devised which was emulated on various real computers, among them the Siemens 2002 and the [[IBM 7090]]. An ALGOL manual was published which provided a detailed introduction of all features of the language with many program snippets, and four appendixes:{{SpecialChars
| alt        = Decimal Exponent Symbol
| link       = http://mailcom.com/unicode/DecimalExponent.ttf
| special    = Unicode 5.2 "[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf Miscellaneous Technical]" characters
| fix        = Unicode#External_links
}}
# Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 
# Report on Subset ALGOL 60 (IFIP)
# Report on Input-Output Procedures for ALGOL 60
# an early "standard" character set for representing [[ALGOL 60]] code on paper and paper tape.
