ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by the [[Open Group]] and is based on the [[IEEE 1471]] standard. It is supported by various tool vendors and consulting firms.


== Overview ==
Just like an architectural drawing in classical building architecture describes the various aspects of the construction and use of a building, ArchiMate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of [[business processes]], organizational structures, [[information flow]]s, IT systems, and technical infrastructure. This insight helps the different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] to design, assess, and communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these business domains.

An [[architecture framework]] is used to structure the concepts and relationships of the ArchiMate language. It divides the [[enterprise architecture]] in to a business, application and technology layer. In each layer, three aspects are considered: active elements that exhibit [[behavior]] (e.g. Process and Function), an internal [[structure]] and elements that define use or communicate [[information]].


== History ==


In 2008 ArchiMate was accepted and hosted as an open standard by the [[Open Group]].

== ArchiMate topics ==

=== Layers ===
* The ''Business layer'' about [[business processes]], services, functions and events of business units. This layer "offers products and services to external customers, which are realized in the organization by business processes performed by business actors and roles". 

* The ''Application layer'' about [[software application]]s that "support the components in the business with application services".  

* The ''Technology layer'' deals "with the [[hardware]] and [[communication]] infrastructure to support the Application Layer. This layer offers infrastructural services needed to run applications, realized by computer and communication hardware and system software".
