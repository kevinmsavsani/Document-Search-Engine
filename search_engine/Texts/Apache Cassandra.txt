The values from a column family for each key are stored together, making Cassandra a hybrid between a [[column-oriented DBMS]] and a row-oriented store.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== History ==

== Features ==
=== Decentralized ===
Every node in the cluster is identical.  There is no [[single point of failure]].

=== Fault-tolerant ===
Data is automatically replicated to multiple nodes for fault-tolerance. Replication across multiple data centers is supported. Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime.

=== Tunable consistency ===
Writes and reads offer a tunable level of consistency, all the way from "writes never fail" to "block for all replicas to be readable", with the quorum level in the middle.

=== Elasticity ===
Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.

== Data model ==
A table in Cassandra is a distributed multidimensional map indexed by a key. The value is an object which is highly structured. The row key in a table is a string with no size restrictions, although typically 16 to 36 bytes long. Every operation under a single row key is atomic per replica no
matter how many columns are being read or written into. Columns are grouped together into sets called column families very much similar to what happens in the [[BigTable]] system. Cassandra exposes two kinds of column families, Simple and Super column families. Super column families can be visualized as a column family within a column family. The top dimension in Cassandra is called Keyspace.

Therefore Cassandra can handle maps with 4 or 5 dimensions:

Map with 4 dimensions:
# Keyspace -> Column Family
# Column Family -> Column Family Row
# Column Family Row -> Columns
# Column -> Data value

Map with 5 dimensions:
# Keyspace -> Super Column Family
# Super Column Family -> Super Column Family Row
# Super Column Family Row -> Super Columns
# Super Column -> Columns
# Column -> Data value

The first dimension - Keyspace -> (Super) Column Family - is limited to a (small) set of schema-predefined keys. Cassandra documentation mentions similarities of this dimension with the table definition inside a relational database.

Furthermore, applications can specify the sort order of columns within a Super Column or Simple Column family. The system allows columns to be sorted either by time or by name. Time sorting of columns is exploited by applications like [[Facebook]] Inbox Search where the results are always displayed
in time sorted order. Any column within a column family is accessed using the convention column_family : column
and any column within a column family that is of type
super is accessed using the convention column_family :
super_column : column.
