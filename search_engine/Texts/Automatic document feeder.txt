There are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided (duplex) scanning: a '''reversing automatic document feeder''' or '''RADF''' scans one side of a page, then flips it and scans the other side. A '''duplexing automatic document feeder''' or '''DADF''' scans both sides in one pass. The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals. RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute (IPM), the number of sides they can scan each minute.
