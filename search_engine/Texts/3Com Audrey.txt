The name ''Audrey'' was given to this first product to honor [[Audrey Hepburn]]. It was meant to deliver the elegance that she exuded. The project codename was "[[Kojak]]", named after the [[Telly Savalas]] character. The follow-on product targeted for the family room was code named "[[Mannix]]".


==Hardware==
The Audrey is a [[touchscreen]], passive matrix LCD device and came equipped with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]].  All applications were touch-enabled.  Since the standard [[infrared]] keyboard was only needed for typing tasks, it could be hung out of the way on the rear of the unit.  The stylus was to be placed in a receptacle on the top of the screen with an [[light-emitting diode|LED]] that flashed when email arrived.  Buttons on the right side of the screen were used to access the web browser, email application, and calendar, and a wheel knob at the bottom selected different "channels" of [[push technology|push]] content.

The 3Com Audrey is powered by a 200 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] GX 1 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], with 16 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[flash ROM]] and 32 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. It measures 9 x 11.8 x 3.0 inches (22.86 x 29.97 x 7.62 cm), and weighs 4.1 pounds (1.86 kg). It is powered by the [[QNX]] [[operating system]].  The Audrey is equipped with a [[modem]], two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, and a [[CompactFlash]] socket.  A USB [[Ethernet]] adapter was commonly used for [[broadband]] subscribers.

The Audrey was also available in such shades as "linen" (off-white), "meadow" (green), "ocean" (blue), "slate" (grey), and "sunshine" (light yellow).

==Hacking==
After the demise of official support, the Audrey drew the attention of computer enthusiasts.  They quickly discovered an [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] to launch a [[pterm]] session.  Using [[privilege escalation]] techniques, the [[superuser|root]] password in the [[Passwd (file)|passwd]] file could be edited, opening the box to further experimentation.


The CompactFlash slot was also investigated.  Although it could not be used for storage expansion, the Audrey was set to flash its operating system from the slot.  Soon, a variety of replacement OS images were distributed among enthusiasts.  As the device could utilize an optional Ethernet connection, it was an easy task to mount a remote disk drive served up by a neighboring desktop system, thus allowing for virtually unlimited storage capability.
