ATi Technologies is a [[fabless semiconductor company]] conducting in-house [[research and development]] and [[outsourcing]] the [[manufacturing]] and assembly of its products. Its main competitor is [[NVIDIA]] in the graphics and handheld market. The flagship product, the [[Radeon]] series of graphics cards, directly competes with [[NVIDIA]]'s [[GeForce]]. These two companies' dominance of the market forced other manufacturers into niche roles.

In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for [[YUV]]-to-[[RGB]] [[color space]] conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration.

ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] accelerator under the name [[ATI Rage|3D Rage]]. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the [[ATI Rage|Rage Pro]] was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to [[3Dfx]]'s 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced [[DirectX|DirectX 6.0]] accelerator in the 1999 [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]].


ATI made an entrance into the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to [[laptop]]s in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from desktop PC, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, [[Transition Minimized Differential Signaling|TMDS]] output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired [[Tseng Labs]]'s graphics assets, which included 40 [[engineer]]s.

The [[Radeon]] line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon [[graphics processing unit]] was an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions.

*'''[[ATI Mach|Mach]] Series''' - Introduced ATI's first [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]] "Windows Accelerator". As the series evolved, GUI acceleration improved dramatically and early video acceleration appeared.
*'''[[ATI Rage|Rage]] Series''' - ATI's first 2D and [[3D accelerator]] chips. The series evolved from rudimentary 3D with 2D GUI acceleration and [[MPEG-1]] capability, to a highly competitive [[Direct3D]] 6 accelerator with then "best-in-class" DVD ([[MPEG2]]) acceleration. The various chips were very popular with [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s of the time. The Rage II was used in the first ATI [[All-In-Wonder]] multi-function video card, and more advanced All-In-Wonders based on Rage series GPUs followed. (1995–2004)
**'''[[ATI_Rage#Mobility|Rage Mobility]]''' - Designed for use in low-power environments, such as notebooks. These chips were functionally similar to their desktop counterparts, but had additions such as advanced [[power management]], [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] interfaces, and [[Multi monitor|dual monitor]] functionality.

*'''[[Radeon]] Series''' - Launched in 2000, the Radeon line is ATI's brand for their consumer 3D accelerator add-in cards. The original ''Radeon DDR'' was ATI's first DirectX 7 3D accelerator, introducing their first hardware [[transform and lighting|T&L]] engine. ATI often produced 'Pro' versions with higher clock speeds, and sometimes an extreme 'XT' version, and even more recently 'XT Platinum Edition (PE)' and 'XTX' versions. The Radeon series was the basis for many ATI All-In-Wonder boards.
*'''[[FireGL]]''' - Launched in 2001, following ATI's acquisition of FireGL Graphics from [[Diamond Multimedia]]. Workstation CAD/CAM video card, based on the Radeon series.
*'''[[FireMV]]''' - For workstations, featuring multi-view, a technology for the need of multiple displays for workstations with 2D acceleration only, usually based on the low-end products of the Radeon series.

*'''Remote Wonder''', wireless remote control series for ATI multimedia products. Operates using radio frequency, away from mainstream implementations using [[Infrared#Communications|infrared]].

===Console graphics products===
*'''[[Nintendo GameCube#Technical specifications|Flipper]]''' - The [[Nintendo GameCube]] (codenamed "dolphin" during production) contains a 3D accelerator developed by ''ArtX, Inc'', a company acquired by ATI during the development of the GPU. Flipper is similar in capability to a [[Direct3D]] 7 accelerator chip. It consists of four rendering pipelines, with hardware [[transform and lighting|T&L]], and some limited pixel shader support. Innovatively the chip has 3 [[MiB]] of embedded [[1T-SRAM]] for use as ultra-fast low-latency (6.2 [[nanosecond|ns]]) texture and [[framebuffer]]/[[Z-buffer]] storage allowing 10.4 [[gigabytes|GB]]/second bandwidth (extremely fast for the time). Flipper was designed by members of the [[Nintendo 64]] Reality Coprocessor team who moved from SGI. The Flipper team went on to have a major hand in the development of the [[Radeon 9700]].
*'''[[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos]]''' - [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] video game console contains a custom graphics chip produced by ATI, known as "R500", "C1", or more often as ''Xenos''. Some of these features include the embedded DRAM ([[eDRAM]]). The Xenos also features the “True Unified Shader Architecture” which dynamically loads and balances pixel and vertex processing amongst a bank of identically capable processing units. This differs greatly from past-generations PC graphics chips that have separate banks of processors designed for their individual task (vertex/fragment). Another feature presented in Xenos is the hardware [[tessellation#Tessellations and computer graphics|surface tessellation]] to divide a surface into smaller triangles, similar to [[TruForm]] in terms of functionality, which is an advanced feature as it is not presented even in the most up-to-date [[Direct3D#Direct3D 10|DirectX 10]] specification. The recent generation [[Radeon R600]] GPU core inherited most of the features presented in Xenos, except [[eDRAM]].
*'''[[Hollywood (graphics chip)|Hollywood]]''' - Successor to Flipper. Part of [[Nintendo]]'s latest gaming console, [[Wii]].

===Handheld chipsets===
*'''[[Imageon]]''' - [[System-on-a-chip]] (SoC) design introduced in 2002 to bring integrated [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics to handhelds devices, cellphones and [[Tablet PC]]s. Current top-of-line product is the Imageon 2298 which includes DVD quality recording and playback, TV output, and supports up to a 12-[[megapixel]] camera, with another line of Imageon products, the 2300 series supporting [[OpenGL]] ES 1.1+ extensions. The Imageon line was rebranded under AMD, after AMD acquired ATI in Q3 2006, as '''AMD Imageon'''.
*'''[[Imageon|Imageon TV]]''' - Announced in February 2006, allowing handhelds devices to receive digital broadcast TV ([[DVB-H]]) signals and enables watching TV programs on these devices, the chipset includes tuner, demodulator, decoder, and a full software stack, operates alongside the [[Imageon]] chip.


In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to [[Qualcomm]], so there will be no new Imageon products.

===High Performance Computing===
*'''[[AMD FireStream]]''', originally ATI Firestream, and previously rebranded as '''AMD Stream Processor''' for a short period of time, utilizing the [[stream processing]] concept, together with [[Close to Metal]] (CTM) hardware interface.

==ATI graphics drivers==
===Proprietary===
{{Main|ATI Catalyst}}

ATI currently provides proprietary graphics [[Device Driver|drivers]], and also assists development of open source drivers. The proprietary drivers are called ATI Catalyst, and are available for most platforms: [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 7]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]]. Linux users can also opt to use open source drivers.

===Open source===
{{Main|Graphics hardware and FOSS#ATI/AMD|l1=Graphics hardware and FOSS}}

{{Quote|Proprietary, patented optimizations are part of the value we provide to our customers and we have no plans to release these drivers to open source. In addition, multimedia elements such as content protection must not, by their very nature, be allowed to go open source.|[http://news.com.com/2061-10791_3-6104655.html ATI statement, August 2006]}}

Since 2007 ATI has cooperated with the development of open source graphics drivers. Although ATI has not made their Catalyst drivers open source, the programming specifications for a number of chipsets and features were published in several rounds. This greatly changed their support of the development of open source graphics drivers, as until that moment only unsupported open source drivers existed. Besides releasing the specifications, ATI also funded the development of new open source drivers, by Novell, for the newest generation of video cards.
