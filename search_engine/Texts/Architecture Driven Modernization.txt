== History of ADM ==

* In November 2003, the OMG's Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force recommended, and the Platform Technical Committee issued, the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel Request For Proposal (RFP).

* In February 2005, the OMG's Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force recommended, and the Platform Technical Committee issued, the Abstract Syntax Tree Metamodel (ASTM) Request For Proposal (RFP). This work is still in progress. OMG has not yet adopted this specification.

* In May 2006, the Team's submission—the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel—was adopted by the OMG and moved into the finalization stage of the OMG's standards adoption process. The OMG adopted Specification for KDM became publicly available (OMG document ptc/06-06-07).

* In September 2006, the OMG's Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force recommended, and the Platform Technical Committee issued, the Software Metrics Metamodel (SMM) Request For Proposal (RFP). This work is still in progress.

* In March 2007 the KDM Finalization Task Force finished the finalization stage of the OMG's standards adoption process. The recommended specification KDM 1.0 is available from OMG

== Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) ==

The foundation of the Architecture-Driven Modernization initiative is the OMG specification [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM).
Usually the knowledge obtained from existing software is presented in the form of models to which specific queries can be made when necessary. An [[entity relationship]] is a frequent format of representing knowledge obtained from existing software. Knowledge Discovery Metamodel defines an ontology for the software assets and their relationships for the purpose of performing knowledge discovery of existing code. Company KDM Analytics is maintaining open Portal for the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (see [http://www.kdmanalytics.com/kdm KDM Portal]).
