[[File:AIBO.JPG|thumb|right|The AIBO ERS-7]]'''AIBO''' ('''A'''rtificial '''I'''ntelligence ro'''BO'''t, homonymous with "pal" or "partner" in Japanese) was one of several types of [[robot]]ic [[pet]]s designed and manufactured by [[Sony]]; there have been several different models since their introduction on May 11, 1999. AIBO was discontinued in 2006.

==Overview==
Being able to walk, "see" its environment via camera and recognize spoken commands in Spanish and English; AIBO robotic pets are considered to be [[autonomous robot]]s since they are able to learn and mature based on external stimuli from their owner or environment, or from other AIBOs. Artist [[Hajime Sorayama]] created the initial designs for the AIBO.

AIBOware (the name is a trademark of Sony corporation), is the title given to the [[software]] the AIBO runs on its pink [[Memory Stick]]. The ''Life'' AIBOware allows the robot to be raised from pup to fully grown adult while going through various stages of development as its owner interacts with it. The ''Explorer'' AIBOware allows the owner to interact with a fully mature robot able to understand (though not necessarily willing to obey) 100 voice commands. Without the AIBOware, the AIBO will run in what is called "clinic mode" and can only perform basic actions.


AIBO's complete vision system uses the [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] algorithm, to recognise its charging station. The newest versions are equipped with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection, allowing them to send the pictures they take via email which led to the [[Roblog]].

AIBO's sounds were programmed by Japanese DJ/avant-garde composer [[Nobukazu Takemura]], fusing mechanic and organic concepts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The bodies of the "3x" series (Latte and Macaron, the round-headed AIBOs released in 2001) were designed by visual artist [[Katsura Moshino]].

==RoboCup==


==International AIBO Convention==
The International AIBO Convention takes place every year at Sony Robotics Tower in the Shinjuku prefecture. The first convention took place in 1999, on May 15. It was then set to May 2 to May 4. The 2009 convention, being in its tenth year, set attendance records. The convention usually features AIBO advertisements, free posters, free accessories, freeware/open-source downloads, an acoustic performance from best friends Mark Linn-Baker and Larry Sweeney, and "AIBO Shows".
