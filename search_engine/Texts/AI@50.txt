While sponsored by [[Dartmouth College]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Frederick Whittemore Foundation]], a $200,000 grant from the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] called for a report of the proceedings that would:

* Analyze progress on AI's original challenges during the first 50 years, and assess whether the challenges were "easier" or "harder" than originally thought and, why

* Document what the AI@50 participants believe are the major research and development challenges facing this field over the next 50 years, and identify what breakthroughs will be needed to meet those challenges
