semantics of the data types is given by an axiomatization enabling proofs and computations on it.


The formalism has two aspects :
* The control part which is handled by a Petri Net.
* The data part which is handled by one or many AADTs.

AADT can be themselves split in two part : 
* The '''signature''' (Sort and Ops in the example below) which gives the valid constants and operations of the [[term algebra]].
* The '''axiomatization''' (Axioms in the example below) which gives the semantic of the operations described in the signature part.

The following picture describes an Algebraic Petri Net model of the Dining Philosophers problem. There are two '''AADT''' in this model, one for the forks algebra, one for the philosophers algebra. Please note that the philosophers AADT uses the fork AADT. Since all philosophers can take their left fork without taking their right fork, executing this model can result in a '''deadlock'''.

The control part is composed of :
* '''Places''' contain '''[[Multiset]]''' (bags) of tokens. Those tokens are elements of a [[term algebra]] built upon the signature of the '''AADT'''(in the example, terms that represent either a philosopher or a fork). Each place contains one and only one multiset of terms, the place is typed by its multiset.
*'''Arcs''' can be labeled with multisets of either closed or free terms. Again terms are built from the AADT signature.

In the example below only transition '''goEat''' is firable at the beginning. One '''goEat''' has been fired, '''takeL''' and '''takeR''' are also enabled and thus can also be fired.

Algebraic Petri Nets are the basic formalism of more advanced ones such as [[CO-OPN]].
