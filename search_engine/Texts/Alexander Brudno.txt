==Biography==

Brudno's work on alpha-beta was published in 1963 in Russian and English.

The algorithm was used in computer [[chess]] program written by [[Georgy Adelson-Velsky]] and others at the [[Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics]] (ITEF or ITEP). According to Monty Newborn and the [[Computer History Museum]], the algorithm was used later in [[Kaissa]] the world computer chess champion in 1974.
