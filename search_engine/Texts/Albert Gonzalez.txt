'''Albert Gonzalez''' (born 1981) is a [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] and [[computer criminal]] who is accused of masterminding the combined [[credit card theft]] and subsequent reselling of more than 170 million card and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] [[Bank card number|numbers]] from 2005 through 2007—the biggest such fraud in history.

Gonzalez and his accomplices used [[SQL injection]] techniques to create [[malware]] [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] on several corporate systems in order to launch [[packet sniffing]] (specifically, [[ARP Spoofing]]) attacks which allowed him to [[Hacker (computer security)|steal computer data]] from internal corporate networks.


Gonzalez had three federal indictments:
*May 2008 in [[New York]] for the Dave & Busters case (trial schedule September 2009)
*May 2008 in [[Massachusetts]] for the TJ Maxx case (trial scheduled early 2010)
*August 2009 in [[New Jersey]] in connection with the Heartland Payment case.

On March 25, 2010, Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

==Arrest==




He was in the [[Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn|Metropolitan Detention Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] when he was indicted in the Heartland attacks.

==Heartland Payment Systems==

Gonzalez and his co-horts targeted large companies and studied their check out terminals and then attacked the companies from internet-connected computers in New Jersey, Illinois, [[Latvia]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Ukraine]].


The indictment said the hackers tested their program against 20 [[anti virus programs]].





==Plea bargain==
On August 28, 2009, his attorney filed papers with the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] in Boston indicating that he would plead guilty to all 19 charges in the U.S. v. Albert Gonzalez, 08-CR-10223, case (the TJ Maxx case).  According to reports this [[plea bargain]] would "resolve" issues with the New York case of U.S. v. Yastremskiy, 08-CR-00160 in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] (the Dave and Busters case).

Gonzalez could serve a term of 15 years to 25 years. He would forfeit more than $1.65 million, a condominium in Miami, a blue 2006 [[BMW 330i]] automobile, [[IBM]] and [[Toshiba]] laptop computers, a Glock 27 firearm, a [[Nokia]] cell phone, a [[Tiffany]] diamond ring and three [[Rolex]] watches.
