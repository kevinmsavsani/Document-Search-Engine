'''Adobe Photoshop''' is a [[Graphics software|graphics editing program]] developed and published by [[Adobe Systems Incorporated]].

Adobe's 2003 "[[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]]" rebranding led to Adobe Photoshop 8's renaming to Adobe Photoshop CS. Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS5 is the [[Adobe Photoshop release history|12th major release]] of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also resulted in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced price. Adobe Photoshop is released in two editions: '''Adobe Photoshop''', and '''Adobe Photoshop Extended''', with the Extended having extra features available. Adobe Photoshop Extended is included in all of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings except Design Standard, which includes the Adobe Photoshop edition. 

Alongside Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Extended, Adobe also publishes [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]] and [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]], collectively called "The Adobe Photoshop Family" by Adobe. In 2008, Adobe released [[Adobe Photoshop Express]], a free [[Web application|web-based]] image editing tool to edit photos directly on blogs and social networking sites.

== Features ==
{{See|Comparison of raster graphics editors#Features}}

Photoshop has ties with other Adobe software for media editing, animation, and authoring.  The '''.PSD''' (Photoshop Document), Photoshop's native format, stores an image with support for most imaging options available in Photoshop.  These include layers with [[image mask|masks]], [[color spaces]], [[ICC profile]]s, transparency, text, [[alpha channels]] and [[spot color]]s, [[clipping path]]s, and [[duotone]] settings.  This is in contrast to many other file formats (e.g. .EPS or .GIF) that restrict content to provide streamlined, predictable functionality.

Photoshop's popularity means that the .PSD format is widely used, and it is supported to some extent by most competing software.  The .PSD file format can be exported to and from [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]], to make professional standard DVDs and provide non-linear editing and special effects services, such as backgrounds, textures, and so on, for television, film, and the Web. Photoshop is a [[raster graphic|pixel-based]] image editor, unlike programs such as [[Macromedia FreeHand]] (now defunct), [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Inkscape]] or [[CorelDraw]], which are [[vector graphics|vector-based]] image editors.

Photoshop uses color models [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[Lab color model|lab]], [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], [[grayscale]], binary [[bitmap]], and [[duotone]]. Photoshop has the ability to read and write [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] image formats such as [[Encapsulated PostScript|.EPS]], [[Portable Network Graphics|.PNG]], [[GIF|.GIF]], [[JPEG|.JPEG]], and [[Adobe Fireworks]].

A version of Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended was used for a Prerelease Beta. A large group of selected Photoshop users were invited to beta test in mid-February 2010.

==Language availabilities==
Photoshop is available in the following languages:



==Plugins==
{{Main|Photoshop plugin}}

Photoshop functionality can be extended by add-on programs called [[Photoshop plugin]]s which act like mini-editors that modify the image. The most common type are filter plugins that provide various image effects. They are located in the 'Filter' menu. Photoshop plugin API has become a standard, and many other image editors also support Photoshop Plugins.
