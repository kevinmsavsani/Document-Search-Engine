In [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]], there are a number of widely used names for the participants in discussions and presentations about various [[protocol (cryptography)|protocols]]. The names are conventional, somewhat self-suggestive, sometimes humorous, and effectively act as [[metasyntactic variable]]s. 

In typical implementations of these protocols, it is understood that the actions attributed to characters such as Alice or Bob need not always be carried out by human parties directly, but also by a trusted automated agent (such as a computer program) on their behalf.  Despite the advantage of Alice and Bob's distinct genders in reducing ambiguity, there has been little tendency to introduce inanimate parties so they could be referred by neuter pronouns.

This list is drawn mostly from the book ''Applied Cryptography'' by [[Bruce Schneier]].  Alice and Bob are archetypes in cryptography; Eve is also common.  Names further down the alphabet are less common.

* '''Alice''' and '''Bob'''. Generally, Alice wants to send a message to Bob. These names were used by [[Ron Rivest]] in the 1978 ''Communications of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'' article presenting the [[RSA]] cryptosystem, and in ''A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems'' published April 4, 1977, revised September 1, 1977 as technical Memo LCS/TM82. Rivest denies that these names have any relation to the 1969 movie ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]'' as occasionally suggested by others.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}
* '''Carol''', '''Carlos''' or '''Charlie''', as a third participant in communications.
* '''Dave''', a fourth participant, and so on alphabetically.
* {{Anchor|Eve}}'''Eve''', an ''eavesdropper'', is usually a passive attacker. While she can listen in on messages between Alice and Bob, she cannot modify them. In [[quantum cryptography]], Eve may also represent the ''environment''.
* '''Fran''', for [[Fran Allen]], Turing award winner
* '''Gordon''', a [[government]] agent.
* '''Isaac''', an [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP).
* '''Ivan''', an ''issuer'' (as in financial cryptography).
* '''Justin''', or '''Julian''' from the ''justice'' system.
* {{Anchor|Mallory}}'''Mallory''', a ''malicious attacker''; unlike Eve, Mallory can modify messages, substitute her own messages, replay old messages, and so on. The problem of securing a system against Mallory is much greater than against Eve. The names '''Marvin''', '''Mallet''', and [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] can also be used for this role.
* {{Anchor|Matilda}}'''Matilda''', a ''merchant'' (as in e-commerce or financial cryptography).
* '''Oscar''', an ''[[Adversary (cryptography)|opponent]]'', is usually taken as equivalent to Mallory.
* '''Pat''' or '''Peggy''', a ''prover'', and '''Victor''', a ''verifier'', often must interact in some way to show that the intended transaction has actually taken place.  They are often found in [[zero-knowledge proof]]s. Another name pair sometimes used is '''Pat''' and '''Vanna''' (after the [[Pat Sajak|host]] and [[Vanna White|hostess]] on the ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' television show).
* '''Plod''', a law enforcement officer from the children's fictional character [[Mr. Plod]], in the ''[[Noddy (character)|Noddy]]'' books by [[Enid Blyton]].
* '''Steve''', sometimes used in reference to [[Steganography]].
* '''Trent''', a ''trusted arbitrator'', is some kind of [[Trusted Third Party|neutral third party]], whose exact role varies with the protocol under discussion.
* '''Trudy''', an intruder: another alternative to Mallory.
* '''Vanna''' or '''Victor''': see '''Pat''' or '''Peggy''' above
* '''Walter''', a ''[[Prison warden|warden]]'', may be needed to guard Alice and Bob in some respect, depending on the protocol being discussed.
* '''Zoe''', often the last party to be involved in a [[cryptographic protocol]].

Although an [[interactive proof system]] is not quite a cryptographic protocol, it is sufficiently related to mention the cast of characters its literature features:
* '''Arthur''' and '''Merlin''': In interactive proof systems, the prover has unbounded computational ability and is hence associated with [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], the powerful [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. He claims the truth of a statement, and [[King Arthur|Arthur]], the wise king, questions him to verify the claim. These two characters also give the name for two [[complexity class]]es, namely [[MA (complexity)|MA]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]].
