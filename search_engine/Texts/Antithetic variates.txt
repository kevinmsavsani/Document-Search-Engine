==Underlying principle==


Suppose that we would like to estimate 

For that we have generated two samples 




And 




==Example 1==


==Example 2: integral calculation==

We would like to estimate



And ''U'' follows a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] [0, 1].

The use of the antithetic variates method to estimate the result shows an important variance reduction.
