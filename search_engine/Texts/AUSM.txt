==Features==
The Advection Upstream Splitting Method has many features. The main features are:
*accurate capturing of shock and contact discontinuities
*entropy-satisfying solution
*positivity-preserving solution
*algorithmic simplicity (not requiring explicit eigen-structure of the flux Jacobian matrices) and straightforward extension to additional conservation laws
*free of “carbuncle” phenomena
*uniform accuracy and convergence rate for all Mach numbers.
Since the method does not specifically require eigenvectors, it is especially attractive for the system whose eigen-structure is not known explicitly, as the case of two-fluid equations for multiphase flow.
