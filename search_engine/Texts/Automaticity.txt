__NOTOC__
'''Automaticity''' ({{pron-en|ˌɔːtəməˈtɪsɨti}}) is the ability to do things without occupying the [[mind]] with the low-level details required, allowing it to become an automatic response pattern or [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. It is usually the result of [[learning]], [[repetition (learning)|repetition]], and practice.

Examples of automaticity are common activities such as speaking, bicycle-riding, assembly-line work, and driving a car (see [[Highway hypnosis]]). After an activity is sufficiently practiced, it is possible to focus the mind on other activities or thoughts while undertaking an automaticized activity (for example, holding a conversation or planning a speech while driving a car). Walking is not an example of automaticity as it is not a cortical function. It is a medullary function, with specific medullary circuits, which can be learnt to be inhibited or altered by higher-order ones.

Some educational software, like [[QuickSmart]], incorporates the concept of automaticity. By measuring the consistency of processing speed and accuracy of students' responses, foundation skills can become automatic. As a result, students can devote cognitive effort to higher-order comprehension skills.
