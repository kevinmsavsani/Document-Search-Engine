In a quantum computer, amplitude amplification can be used to obtain a
quadratic speedup over several classical algorithms.

rotating the state between the ''good'' and ''bad'' subspaces.
The probability is maximized if we choose
Up until this point each iteration increases the amplitude of the ''good'' states, hence
the name of the technique.

== Applications ==

Assume we have an unsorted database with N elements, and an oracle function

If there are G such entries in the database in total, then we can find them by
initializing the quantum computer into a uniform superposition
of all the database elements,
and running the above algorithm. In this case the overlap of the initial state with the ''good'' subspace is equal to the
= \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4 \arcsin(a)}\right\rfloor
\approx \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4 a}\right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{N}{G}}\right\rfloor = O(\sqrt{N}).
Measuring the state will now give one of the ''good'' entries with a high probability. Since each iteration requires a single oracle query,

If we set G to one, the above scenario essentially reduces to the original Grover search.
