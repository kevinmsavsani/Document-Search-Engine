'''Ahmed Hassan Zewail''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد حسن زويل}}) (born February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]], [[Egypt]]) is an [[Egypt]]ian-[[United States|American]] scientist, and the winner of the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[femtochemistry]]. He is the Linus Pauling Chair Professor Chemistry and Professor of Physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]].

== Birth and education ==
Ahmad Zewail was born on February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]] and raised in [[Disuq]]. He received bachelor's degree and MS degree from the [[University of Alexandria]] before moving from [[Egypt]] to the United States to complete his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with advisor Dr. [[Robin Hochstrasser]]. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with advisor Dr. [[Charles B. Harris]].

== Academic career ==
After some post doctorate work at [[UC-Berkeley]], he was awarded a faculty appointment at [[Caltech]] in 1976, where he has remained since. He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1982, and in 1990, he was made the first ''[[Linus Pauling]] Chair in Chemical Physics''.

Dr. Zewail has been nominated and will participate in President Barack Obama's Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The council will talk about education, science, defense, energy, the economy, and technology.

== Research ==
Zewail's key work has been as the pioneer     of [[femtochemistry]]&mdash;i.e. the study of [[chemical reaction]]s across [[femtosecond]]s. Using a rapid [[ultrafast]] [[laser]] technique (consisting of [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales - short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions.



Zewail is married, and has four children.
