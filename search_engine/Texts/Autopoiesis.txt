'''Autopoiesis''' literally means "auto (self)-creation" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: αυτό – ''auto'' for "self"; and ποίησις – ''poiesis'' for "creation or production"), and expresses a fundamental [[dialectic]] between [[structure]] and [[function (engineering)|function]].

==Meaning==
The term was originally introduced by Chilean biologists [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] in 1972:


The term ''autopoiesis'' was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of [[living systems]]. A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the [[biological cell]]. The [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell, for example, is made of various biochemical components such as [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s, and is organized into bounded structures such as the [[cell nucleus]], various [[organelle]]s, a [[cell membrane]] and [[cytoskeleton]]. These structures, based on an external flow of molecules and energy, ''produce'' the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components. 

An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an [[allopoietic]] system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something ''other'' than itself (the factory).


An application of the concept to [[sociology]] can be found in [[Niklas Luhmann#Theory|Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Systems theory#Sociology and Sociocybernetics|Systems Theory]], which was subsequently adapted by [[Bob Jessop]] in his studies of the capitalist state system. [[Marjatta Maula]] adapted the concept of autopoiesis in a business context.
