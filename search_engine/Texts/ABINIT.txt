A web-based easy-to-use [http://nanohub.org/resources/ABINIT graphical version] of the package is available for free use through the [[nanohub]].

ABINIT also includes options to
* optimize the [[geometry]] according to the DFT forces and stresses;
* perform [[molecular dynamics]] [[simulation]]s using these forces; and
* generate [[Dynamical system|dynamical]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[Max Born|Born]] effective [[Electric charge|charges]], and [[dielectric]] [[tensor]]s.

[[Excited state]]s can be computed within the [[time-dependent density functional theory]] (for molecules), or within [[Many-body problem|many-body]] [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] (the [[GW approximation]]). In addition to the main ABINIT [[code]], different [[utility program]]s are also provided.
