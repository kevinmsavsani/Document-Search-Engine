A '''Beanie Baby''' is a [[Stuffed toy|stuffed animal]], made by [[Ty Warner|Ty Warner Inc.]], which was later renamed as [[Ty Inc.]] in late 1993. Each toy has an inner "posable lining" and is stuffed with plastic pellets (or "beans") rather than conventional stuffing (see [[polyvinylchloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene|PE]]), giving Beanie Babies a flexible feel.


The line became a phenomenon in the late 1990s when Beanie Babies became both a [[fad]] and a collectible. Ty, Inc. stopped producing the product in 1999; but consumer demand led them to reconsider. In 2000, a Beanie Baby named "The Beginning" was introduced to remind people of Beanie Babies' comeback.

[[Teenie Beanies]], an offshoot of the Beanie Babies line, were made by additional manufacturers for a few [[McDonalds]] [[Happy Meal]] promotions. They are not new Beanie Babies, but Beanie Babies in a smaller size.

==Sociology of Beanie Babies==
The phenomenon of Beanie Babies is an example of a product of [[popular culture]]. Based on the sales and revenue of this toy, Ty Warner Inc. created an empire worth over $6 billion. In 1995, there was fear that the public was losing interest in this hot commodity. In fact, demand was increasing significantly, resulting in a profit of $250 million in the following year, with substantial re-sale value in the secondary market. In 2008 Ty, Inc. released a follow-up line, [[Beanie Babies 2.0]], for use on online games on the Ty website.

===Marketing strategies===
# Reasonable Price: [[Ty Warner]] wanted to keep Beanie Babies selling at a reasonable price, but did not want to mass produce them. In doing so, he followed steps 4 and 5 by limiting production and distribution by only selling to smaller retailers.
# Keep it Secretive: [[Ty Warner]] was able to keep people interested because they weren’t jaded by the constant advertisements that most large toy companies use; when people don’t know what to expect, it becomes more appealing.
# Surprise People: Unpredictability became entertaining to the mass public and made people even more eager to engage in the collection process of Beanie Babies.
# Limit Production: Limiting production ensured that keeping some Beanie Babies rare would keep people excited.
# Avoid Large Chain Retailers: Unlike most toys that are mass produced and retailed to major toy stores, Beanie Babies were sold at smaller, more refined specialty shops. This helped sustain the authentic image of Beanie Babies.
# Simplicity: Because only a few different colors of fabric were used for each Beanie Baby, costs were kept low. At the same time, this simplicity appealed to everyone because what they saw is what they got.
# Personification: Personification made Beanie Babies easier to relate to; every Beanie Baby had a Ty tag with a unique name, birthday, and poem. This only increased the excitement of the buyers because it was no longer just a [[stuffed animal]].
# Variety: Producing a variety of Beanie Babies attracted everyone because this tactic aims to please everyone’s taste. This ploy also made serious collectors more eager to collect every Beanie Baby out there.
# Retirements: Retirement created frenzy among Beanie Baby consumers. When Ty would retire a certain Beanie Baby, demand would increase, while supply came to a halt.

Competition against Beanie Babies was limited; substitutes were rare and unsuccessful in the marketplace.

===Tags===
The tags on Beanie Babies are considered a very important part when assessing their orverall value. It is widely believed by collectors that a Beanie without a tag or a damaged tag loses up to half of its value. Every Beanie Baby has least two factory made tags: a [[swing tag]] (also known as a "hang tag", "ear tag" or "name tag") which includes the beanies name, date of birth and a small story. There is also the [[tush tag]] (usually attached to the Beanie's rear end). Both tags have gone through many changes over time; these changes have become known as "generations". There are currently 15 generations of swing tags and 13 generations of tush tags. Additionally, there are also extra tags for certain regions that include things like safety information to comply with the Canadian [[Stuffed Articles Act]] or the [[CE Mark]] requirements in [[Europe]].


A few tag "generations" have become particularly noteworthy. Most Beanie Babies with first, second, or third generation hang tags have held their value (or in the case of some harder to find styles, increased in value), while fourth and fifth generation hang tags indicate Beanies that were available during the Beanie fad.

===Beanie Babies 2.0===
In an attempt to beat out the Webkinz craze,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} in early 2008, Ty decided it was time for Beanie Babies to go online. This new version of Beanie Babies was called [[Beanie Babies 2.0]]. The purchase of a Beanie Baby 2.0 provided its owner with a code to access a Beanie Babies interactive website.

===Rarity===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
During the Beanie Baby craze, the rarest general issue beanie, according to the Winter 2000 edition of ''Ty Beanie Babies'', published by Collectors Value Guide, was considered to be the dark blue variation of "Peanut" the elephant. [[List of Beanie Babies#P|Peanut]] was available well into 1998 in a lighter hue, but the dark blue version that was only made accidentally in 1995 rose in value because of its scarcity. "Nana the monkey" was considered the second rarest Beanie Baby; because only a few early 3rd gen tags use that name instead of Bongo. The early wingless version of "Quackers" the [[duck]], "Chilly" the [[polar bear]], the earlier versions of "Nip" and "Zip" the cats, "Peking" the [[panda bear]];  "Teddy" the bear (Especially the cranberry coloured one)  and "Humphrey" the [[camel]] also command high prices.
Some special edition Beanies, such as the #1 Bear or the Billionaire bears (which are only available as gifts to Ty employees), are hard to come across and highly valued.
Earlier editions of common Beanie Babies (particularly with first or second generation hang tags) are often sought-after by collectors. Particular hang tag variations in mint condition continue to make record prices on [[eBay]].


==Notable Beanie Babies==
===Garcia the bear===
'''Garcia''' the bear was released in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a [[tie-dye]]d bear that seems to be a tribute to [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]]. A group of differently colored dancing bears, originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The guitarist and the bear share a birthday, but the bear was supposedly "born" the year that Jerry died (Aug 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name "Garcia" was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named '''Peace''' was released.


===Princess the bear===

On the other hand, '''Princess''' bears are dark purple. She has a symbol on the right side of her chest which is a rose with white petals on it. '''Princess'''' rear end tag which says her name is special, because it is in a cursive-like font. Some '''Princess''' bears have a heart on their tag protector, if any.

===Decade the bear===
[[File:Decadethebear.JPG|thumb|right|180px|'''Decade''' the bear]]

'''Decade''' the bear was made in honor of Beanie Babies' tenth anniversary. Decade bears were made in white, royal blue, red, purple, orange, hot pink, green, gold, brown, and light blue. Most '''Decade''' bears have silver sparkles on their bodies.

==Licensed Beanies==
In the late 2000s, Beanie Babies modeled after characters from popular children's franchises by [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] began appearing. These included characters from [[cartoons]] on the Nickelodeon television channel such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', as well as characters from [[DreamWorks Animation]] movies such as ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and most recently, 20th Century Fox's [[Ice Age 3|Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs]].
