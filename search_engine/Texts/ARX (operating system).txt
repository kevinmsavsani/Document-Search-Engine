It was not finished in time to be fitted to the Acorn Archimedes range of computers, which shipped in 1987 with the [[Arthur (operating system)|Arthur]] operating system, derived from the earlier [[Acorn MOS|MOS]] operating system from Acorn's earlier [[8-bit]] [[BBC Micro]] range. Arthur was later superseded by [[RISC OS]].

The Acorn Research Centre was bought out by [[Olivetti]].
