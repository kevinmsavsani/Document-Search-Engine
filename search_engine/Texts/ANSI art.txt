ANSI art is considerably more flexible than ASCII art, because the particular character set it uses contains symbols intended for drawing, such as a wide variety of box-drawing characters and block characters that [[dithering|dither]] the foreground and background color. It also adds accented characters and math symbols that often find creative use among ANSI artists.

The popularity of ANSI art encouraged the creation of a powerful shareware package called [[TheDraw]] coded by Ian E. Davis in 1986. Not only did it considerably simplify the process of making an ANSI art screen from scratch, but it also included a variety of "fonts", large letters constructed from box and block characters, and transition animations such as ''dissolve'' and ''clock''. No new versions of TheDraw emerged after version 4.63 in 1993, but in later years a number of other ANSI editors appeared, some of which are still maintained today.

The decline of both BBSes and DOS users has made it difficult for many users to even view ANSI animations. As a consequence, this form of art is no longer practiced to the degree it once was.

The popular game creation system (GCS) ''[[ZZT]]'' used ANSI graphics exclusively. A later GCS based on the same concept, ''[[MegaZeux]]'', allowed users to modify the extended ASCII character set as well.

[[Trade Wars 2002]], a multiplayer BBS game that remains popular 20 years after its release in 1986, used ANSI graphics to depict ships, planets, and important locations, and included cutscenes and even a cinema with ANSI animations.  Many of these ANSI graphics were created by Drew Markham, who went on to form [[Xatrix]]/[[Gray Matter Interactive]] and develop ''[[Redneck Rampage]]'' and ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', among other titles.

[[Dwarf Fortress]] is another game, first released in 2002, leveraging ANSI graphics. Dwarf Fortress' default graphics is exclusively ANSI [[code page 437]] characters.
