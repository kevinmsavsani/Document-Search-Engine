The Altix brand has been also used for a variety of systems based on [[multi-core]] Intel [[Xeon]] processors. These includes the '''Altix XE''' [[rackmount]] servers, '''Altix ICE''' [[blade server]]s and '''Altix UV''' supercomputers.

[[NASA]]'s [[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]] [[supercomputer]], installed in 2004, is a 10,240-microprocessor cluster of twenty Altix 3000 systems, each with 512 microprocessors, interconnected with [[InfiniBand]].

== Altix 3000 ==

The Altix 3000 was the first generation of Altix systems. It was succeeded by the Altix 4000 in 2004, and the last model was discontinued on 31 December 2006.

=== Altix 330 ===

The '''Altix 330''' is an entry-level server. Unlike the high-end models, the Altix 330 is not "brick" based, but is instead based on 1U-high compute modules mounted in a rack and connected with [[NUMAlink]]. A single system may contain 1 to 16 Itanium 2 processors and 2 to 128 GB of memory.

=== Altix 350 ===

The '''Altix 350''' is a mid-range model which supports up to 32 Itanium 2 processors.

=== Altix 1330 ===

The '''Altix 1330''' is a [[cluster (computing)|cluster]] of Altix 330 systems. The systems are networked with [[gigabit Ethernet]] or 4X [[Infiniband]].

=== Altix 1350 ===

The '''Altix 1350''' is a cluster of Altix 350 systems.

=== Altix 3300 ===

The '''Altix 3300''' is a mid-range model supporting 4 to 12 processors and 2 to 48 GB of memory. It is packaged in a short (17U) rack.

=== Altix 3700 ===

The '''Altix 3700''' is a high-end model supporting 16 to 512 processors and 8 GB to 2 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (39U) rack(s). A variant of the Altix 3000 with graphics capability is known as the [[SGI Prism|Prism]].

It is based on the third generation NUMAflex [[distributed shared memory]] architecture and it uses the [[NUMAlink#NUMAlink 4|NUMAlink 4]] interconnection fabric. The Altix 3000 supports a single system image of 64 processors. If there are more than 64 processors in a system, then the system must be partitioned.

The basic building block is the C-brick. Each C-brick contains two nodes. A C-brick is a 4U high rackmount unit. Each node contains two [[Intel]] [[Itanium|Itanium 2]] processors which connects to the Super-Bedrock [[Application specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] through a single [[front side bus]]. The Super-Bedrock ASIC is a [[crossbar]] for the processors, the local RAM, the network interface and the I/O interface. The two Super-Bedrock ASICs in each brick are connected internally by a single 6.4 GB/s NUMAlink 4 channel. A processor node also contains 16 [[DIMM]] slots that accept standard [[DDR1]] DIMMs with capacities of 4 to 16 GB.

=== Altix 3700 Bx2 ===

The '''Altix 3700 Bx2''' is a high-end model supporting 16 to 2,048 Itanium 2 processors and 12 GB to 24 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (40U) rack(s).

== Altix 4000 ==

The '''Altix 4000''' is Silicon Graphics' current Itanium-based product line. It is composed of two models, the '''Altix 450''', a mid-range server, and the '''Altix 4700''', a high-end server.


These systems are based on nodes contained within a [[Blade (computing)|blade]] that plugs into an enclosure, the individual rack unit (IRU). The IRU is a 10U enclosure that contains the necessary components to support the blades such as the power supplies, two router boards (one for every five blades) and a L1 controller. Each IRU can support ten single-wide blades or two double-wide blades and eight single-width blades. The IRUs are mounted in 42U-high rack, and each rack supports up to four IRUs.

There are two types of node, processor and memory, which are contained within a blade. Compute blades contain a processor node and consist of two PAC611 sockets for Itanium 2 and Itanium microprocessors, a Super-Hub (SHub) [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) ([[chipset]]) and eight [[dual in-line memory module]] (DIMM) slots for memory. The number of microprocessor sockets in a compute blade is one or two. One-processor socket configurations provide more bandwidth as only one microprocessor socket is using the front side bus and local memory. Two-processor socket configurations do not support hyperthreading. Memory blades are used to expand the amount of memory without increasing the number of processors. They contain a SHub ASIC and 12 DIMM slots. Both compute and memory blades support 1, 2 4, 8, and 16 GB DIMMs.  SGI support does not currently support any installations with 16GB DIMMs.

Multiple servers in configurations described above can be combined on the same Numalink fabric up to the theoretical maximum of 8,192 nodes (16,384 OS cpus).

== Altix XE ==

and Microsoft Windows.  Later, VMware support was added across the Altix XE product line.

== Altix ICE ==

The '''Altix ICE''' blade platform is an Intel Xeon-based system featuring diskless compute blades and a Hierarchical Management Framework (HMF) for scalability, performance, and resiliency.  While the earlier Itanium-based Altix systems ran a [[single-system image]] (SSI) [[Linux kernel]] on 1024 processors or more using a standard [[SuSE Linux Enterprise Server]] (SLES) distribution, the Altix ICE's clustering capabilities uses standard SLES or [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] distributions and scales to over 51,200 cores on [[NASA]]'s [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades]] [[supercomputer]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The '''Altix ICE 8200LX''' blade enclosure featured two 4x DDR IB switch blade and one high performing plane, while the '''Altix ICE 8200EX''' featured four 4x DDR IB switch blades, and two high performing planes.  Both configurations supported either [[hypercube]] or [[fat tree]] topology, and 16 compute blades within an IRU.

The IP-83 and IP-85 compute blades supported Intel Xeon 5200 or 5400 Series processors, and the IP-95 compute blade supported Intel Xeon 5500 Series processors.

{{As of|2010|11|alt=As of fall 2010}}, the current product is the ICE 8400, based on either Intel Xeon 5500 or 5600 processors or the AMD Opteron 6100 series processors.
