==Overview==




==Operation==

Arnetminer automatically extracts the researcher profile from the web. It collects and identifies the relevant pages, then uses a unified approach to extract data from the identified documents. It also extracts publications from online digital libraries using heuristic rules.

It integrates the extracted researchersâ€™ profiles and the extracted publications. It employs the researcher name as the identifier. A probabilistic framework has been proposed to deal with the name ambiguity problem in the integration. The integrated data is stored into a researcher network knowledge base (RNKB).

The principal other product in the area are Google Scholar, Elsevier's Scirus, and the open source project CiteSeer.
