'''Adobe Illustrator Artwork''' ('''AI''') is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[file format]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] for representing single-page [[vector graphics|vector-based drawings]] in either the [[Encapsulated_PostScript|EPS]] or [[PDF]] formats.  The '''.ai''' [[filename extension]] is used by [[Adobe Illustrator]].

Early versions of the AI file format are true [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] files with a restricted, compact syntax, with additional semantics represented by Illustrator-specific [[Document Structuring Conventions|DSC comments]] that conform to DSC's Open Structuring Conventions. These files are identical to their corresponding Illustrator EPS counterparts, but with the EPS procsets ([[library (computing)|procedure sets]]) omitted from the file and instead externally referenced using %%Include [[directive]]s.

{{Expert-subject||paragraph (below)|talk=What is the PGF that AI is supposed to be based on?}}
Recent versions of the AI file format, including the PDF-based formats and recent EPS formats, are based on a native format called [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] that is unrelated to both EPS and PDF. PDF compatibility is achieved not by extending the PDF format, but by embedding a complete copy of the native [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] data within the PDF file. The same kind of “dual path” approach is also used when recent versions of Illustrator are saving EPS-compatible files.

==Programs that support AI files==
Aside from Adobe Illustrator, the following applications can edit .ai files:
*[[Corel Paint Shop Pro]] (another proprietary program) can natively edit this file format.
*[[Ghostscript]] (another GPL-licensed program) can convert AI postscript files into various formats, and also allows programs that use Ghostscript such as [[GIMP]] to import AI files.
*[[Skencil]] (another GPL-licensed program) also claims to have some AI support.
*[[FlexiSign]] (Vector Program used in Signmaking) Can read AI files.
*[[EnRoute]] (Vector program for routers) Can read AI files.
Viewers:
* [[Adobe Reader]] can open .ai files for viewing if they are saved with the PDF compatibility option
* [[Preview (software)|Preview]] can view .ai files
