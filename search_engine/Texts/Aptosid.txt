sidux was maintained by a team of developers including former [[Kanotix]] developer Stefan Lippers-Hollmann (slh). Initial administration was managed by ''The sidux Foundation, Inc.'' located in the [[United States]]. The Berlin, Germany based non-profit organization [http://sidux-ev.de ''sidux e.V.''] was administering and supporting the project.

Due to disagreement between sidux e.V. and the sidux developers, all development of sidux has been halted in summer 2010 until September 2010. The entire project has been renamed as '''aptosid''', announced on 2010-09-11. aptosid is a direct upgrade from sidux. The first time a user runs an apt-get dist-upgrade in sidux, they are asked if they want their repositories changed to the new aptosid site and the system will be seamlessly upgraded to aptosid.

==Features==

One of aptosid's and sidux's more notable features, unlike most other Linux distributions, they utilize a true [[Rolling release|'rolling-release-cycle']], and thus continue to remain current. Users can update all of the system's packages via the command 'apt-get dist-upgrade'. Through this model, there should not, in theory, ever be a need to overwrite a aptosid or sidux system by installing an entirely new version. Other Linux distributions that use the rolling release model include [[Arch Linux]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]].

===Live CD - DVD - USB===

===Installer===
The graphical [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]] can be started directly from live mode, without rebooting. aptosid and sidux can be installed to USB-connected hard disks and [[USB flash drive]]s, as well as to internal [[Hard disk drive|hard disks]].

===Updates===
Once aptosid or sidux is installed, it can be kept up-to-date with updates from the Debian Sid and aptosid repositories.  Updates are typically run from command line using [[apt-get]].  Because post and pre install scripts in the Debian packages may restart your display manager during updates and cause conflicts with running userspace applications, it is recommended that users upgrade their system outside of X (i.e. while NOT running the 'GUI').  This is achieved by applying all updates at 'run-level 3'.

Warnings regarding upgrades are posted on the main website and in the Upgrade Warnings section of the forum.

===Support===

===Multilingual===
The default language of aptosid releases is English, however German, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Greek, English (GB), French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (BR and PT), Romanian, Russian and Spanish localisations ([[i18n]] support) are also provided within the DVD, selectable at boot prompt.

===Packages===
aptosid comes with a selection of programs, covering system rescue and web surfing.
To mention a few: [[KDE]] / [[Xfce]] desktop, [[openoffice]], [[iceweasel]], [[Amarok (software)|amarok]], [[digikam]], [[gparted]], [[gwenview]], [[k3b]], [[kaffeine]], [[koffice]], [[krita]], [[krusader]], [[Scanner Access Now Easy|sane]], [[Video Disk Recorder|vdr]],  [[virtualbox]], [[Wireless tools for Linux|wireless-tools]], [[xawtv]], [[yakuake]], ...


==Releases==
The releases were usually available in 4 CD versions, however since release 2007-04.5 a fully equipped DVD and two light CDs will be offered [ftp://debian.tu-bs.de/project/aptosid/release here].
Since 2008-02 also an ~420 MB large Xfce variant is available.
DVD Versions at the end of a year contain more programs and preinstalled languages.
