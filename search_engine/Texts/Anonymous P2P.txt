An '''anonymous P2P''' communication system is a [[peer-to-peer]] distributed application in which the nodes or participants are [[anonymity|anonymous]] or [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]]. Anonymity of participants is usually achieved by special routing [[overlay network]]s that hide the physical location of each node from other participants.


==Motivation for anonymity==
There are many reasons to use anonymous P2P technology; most of them are generic to all forms of online anonymity.

P2P users who desire anonymity usually do so as they do not wish to be identified as a publisher (sender), or reader (receiver), of information. Common reasons include:

* The material or its distribution is illegal or incriminating
* Material is legal but socially deplored, embarrassing or problematic in the individual's social world (for example, anonymity is seen as a key requirement for organizations like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]])
* Fear of retribution (against whistleblowers, unofficial leaks, and activists who do not believe in restrictions on information or knowledge)
* Censorship at the local, organizational, or national level
* Personal privacy preferences such as preventing [[Web visitor tracking|tracking]] or [[datamining]] activities

A particularly open view on legal and illegal content is given in [http://freenetproject.org/philosophy.html The Philosophy Behind Freenet].

Governments are also interested in anonymous P2P technology. The [[United States]] [[Navy]] funded the original [[onion routing]] research that led to the development of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network, which was later funded by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and is now developed by the non-profit organization The Tor Project, Inc.

==Arguments for and against anonymous P2P communication==
===General===
While anonymous P2P systems may support the protection of unpopular speech, they may also protect illegal activities not protected under some free speech laws, such as [[fraud]], [[slander and libel|libel]], the exchange of illegal [[pornography]], the unauthorized copying of copyrighted works, or the planning of criminal activities. Critics{{Who|date=October 2009}} of anonymous P2P systems hold that the advantages offered by such systems do not outweigh these disadvantages, and that other communication channels are already sufficient for unpopular speech.

Some{{Who|date=October 2009}} proponents of anonymous P2P systems believe that all restrictions on free speech serve authoritarian interests. Others{{Who|date=October 2009}} argue that information itself is ethically neutral, and that it is the people acting upon the information that can be good or evil. Perceptions of good and evil can also change (see [[moral panic]]); for example, if anonymous peer-to-peer networks had existed in the 1950s or 1960s, they might have been targeted for carrying information about [[civil rights]] or [[anarchism]].


===Freedom of speech===
Some claim that true [[freedom of speech]], especially on controversial subjects, is difficult or impossible unless individuals can speak anonymously. If anonymity is not possible, one could be subjected to threats or reprisals for voicing an unpopular view. This is one reason why voting is done by secret ballot in many democracies. Controversial information which a party wants to keep hidden, such as details about corruption issues, is often published or leaked anonymously.

====Anonymous blogging====
Anonymous blogging is one widespread use of anonymous networks.



====Censorship via Internet domain names====
{{Unclear section|date=April 2009}}
shows that domain names are extremely vulnerable to censorship. Some domain registrars have suspended customers' domain names even in the absence of a court order.

For the affected customer, blocking of a domain name is a far bigger problem than a registrar refusing to provide a service; typically, the registrar keeps full control over the domain names in question.

Anonymous networks, on the other hand, do not rely on domain name registrars. For example, [[Freenet]] implements censorship-resistant URLs based on [[public-key cryptography]]: only a person having the correct private key is able to update the URL or take it down.

===Control over online tracking===
Anonymous P2P also has value in normal daily communication. When communication is anonymous, the decision to reveal the identities of the communicating parties is left up to the parties involved and is not available to a third party. Often there is no need or desire by the communicating parties to reveal their identities. As a matter of personal freedom, many people do not want processes in place by default which supply unnecessary data. In some cases such data could be compiled into histories of their activities.

For example, most current phone systems transmit caller ID information by default to the called party (although this can be disabled either for a single call or for all calls). If a person calls to make an inquiry about a product or the time of a movie, the party called has a record of the calling phone number, and may be able to obtain the name, address and other information about the caller. This information is not available about someone who walks into a store and makes a similar inquiry.

===Effects of surveillance on lawful activity===


===Access to censored and copyrighted material===
Most countries ban or censor the publication of certain [[list of banned books|books]] and [[banned films|movies]], and certain types of content. Other material is legal to possess but not to distribute; for example, copyright and [[software patent]] laws may forbid its distribution. These laws are difficult or impossible to enforce in anonymous P2P networks.

===Anonymous online money===

Some{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that conventional [[cash]] provides a similar kind of anonymity, and that existing laws are adequate to combat crimes like [[tax evasion]] that might result from the use of anonymous cash, whether online or offline{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

==Functioning of anonymous P2P==
===Anonymity and pseudonymity===
Some of the networks commonly referred to as "anonymous P2P" are truly anonymous, in the sense that network nodes carry no identifiers. Others are actually [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]]: instead of being identified by their [[Internet Protocol|IP addresses]], nodes are identified by pseudonyms such as cryptographic keys. For example, each node in the [[MUTE]] network has an overlay address that is derived from its [[public-key cryptography|public key]]. This overlay address functions as a pseudonym for the node, allowing messages to be addressed to it. In [[Freenet]], on the other hand, messages are routed using keys that identify specific pieces of data rather than specific nodes; the nodes themselves are anonymous.

The term ''anonymous'' is used to describe both kinds of network because it is difficult—if not impossible—to determine whether a node that sends a message originated the message or is simply forwarding it on behalf of another node. Every node in an anonymous P2P network acts as a universal sender and universal receiver to maintain anonymity. If a node was only a receiver and did not send, then neighbouring nodes would know that the information it was requesting was for itself only, removing any [[plausible deniability]] that it was the recipient (and consumer) of the information. Thus, in order to remain anonymous, nodes must ferry information for others on the network.

===Spam and DoS attacks in anonymous networks===
Originally, anonymous networks were operated by small and friendly communities of developers. As interest in anonymous P2P increased and the user base grew, malicious users inevitably appeared and tried different attacks. This is similar to the Internet, where widespread use has been followed by waves of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and distributed [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Such attacks may require different solutions in anonymous networks. For example, blacklisting of originator network addresses does not work because anonymous networks conceal this information. These networks are more vulnerable to DoS attacks as well due to the smaller bandwidth, as has been shown in examples on the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network.

However, a conspiracy to attack an anonymous network could be considered criminal computer hacking{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Participants in the network interested in ensuring the continuous availability of it could collaborate to identify the source of abusive traffic, and further investigate or prosecute it. This could be done without compromising the anonymity of data in the network.

==Opennet and darknet network types==
{{Main|Friend-to-friend}}
Like conventional P2P networks, anonymous P2P networks can implement either opennet or [[Darknet (file sharing)|darknet]] (often named [[friend to friend]]) network type. This describes how a node on the network selects peer nodes:

* In opennet network, peer nodes are discovered automatically. There is no configuration required but little control available over which nodes become peers.
* In a darknet network, users manually establish connections with nodes run by people they know. Darknet typically needs more effort to set up but a node only has trusted nodes as peers.

Some networks like [[Freenet]] support both network types simultaneously (a node can have some manually-added darknet peer nodes and some automatically-selected opennet peers) .

In a friend-to-friend (or F2F) network, users only make direct connections with people they know. Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two "friends", without telling either of them the other's name or IP address. These "friends" can in turn forward the same file (or request) to their own "friends", and so on.
Users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity.

Some [[friend-to-friend]] networks allow the user to control what kind of files can be exchanged with "friends" within the node, in order to stop them from exchanging files that user disapproves of.

Advantages and disadvantages of opennet compared to darknet are disputed, see [[Friend to Friend]] article for summary.

===Private P2P clients===
[[Private P2P]] networks are P2P networks that only allow some mutually trusted computers to share files. This can be achieved by using a central server or [[Direct Connect (file sharing)#Hubs|hub]] to authenticate clients, in which case the functionality is similar to a private [[FTP]] server, but with files transferred directly between the clients. Alternatively, users can exchange passwords or keys with their friends to form a decentralized network.

===Friend-to-friend clients===
[[Friend-to-friend]] networks are P2P networks that allows users only to make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication.

===Anonymous P2P in a wireless mesh network===
It is possible to implement anonymous P2P on a [[wireless mesh network]]; unlike fixed internet connections, users don't need to sign up with an ISP to participate in such a network, and are only identifiable through their hardware. Even if a government were to outlaw the use of wireless P2P software, it would be difficult to enforce such a ban without a considerable infringement of personal freedoms. Alternatively, the government could outlaw the purchase of the wireless hardware itself. Protocols for wireless mesh networks are [[OLSR]] and the follow-up protocol [[B.A.T.M.A.N.]], which is designed for decentralized auto-IP assignment. See also [[Netsukuku]].
