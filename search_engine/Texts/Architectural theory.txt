'''Architectural theory''' is the act of thinking, discussing, or most importantly writing about [[architecture]]. Architectural theory is taught in most architecture schools and is practiced by the world's leading [[architect]]s. Some forms that architecture theory takes are the [[lecture]] or dialogue, the treatise or book, and the paper project or [[architectural design competition|competition entry]]. Architectural theory is often didactic, and theorists tend to stay close to or work from within schools. It has existed in some form since [[ancient history|antiquity]], and as publishing became more common, architectural theory gained an increased richness. Books, magazines, and journals published an unprecedented amount of works by architects and critics in the 20th century. As a result, styles and movements formed and dissolved much more quickly than the relatively enduring modes in earlier history. It is to be expected that the use of the internet will further the discourse on architecture in the twenty 1st century.

==History==
===Antiquity===
There is little information or evidence about major architectural theory in antiquity, until the 1st century BCE, with the work of [[Vitruvius]]. This does not mean, however, that such works did not exist. Many works never survived antiquity, and the burning of the [[Alexandria Library]] shows us a very good example of this.


===Middle Ages===

===Renaissance===

The first great work of architectural theory of this period belongs to [[Leon Battista Alberti]], ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', which placed Vitruvius at the core of the most profound theoretical tradition of the modern ages. From Alberti, good architecture is validated through the Vitruvian triad, which defines its purpose. This triplet conserved all its validity until the 19th century.

===Enlightenment===

Major architectural theorists of the Enlightenment include Julien-David Leroy, Abbé Marc-Antoine Laugier, Giovanni Battista Piranesi,  
Robert Adam, James Stuart, and Nicholas Revett.


===Nineteenth century===
A vibrant strain of [[Neoclassicism]], inherited from [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]'s seminal Essai, provided the foundation for two generations of international activity around the core themes of classicism, [[primitivism]] and a "return to Nature." 

Reaction against the dominance of [[neo-classical architecture]] came to the fore in the 1820s with [[Augustus Pugin]] providing a moral and theoretical basis for [[Gothic Revival architecture]], and in the 1840s [[John Ruskin]] developed this ethos.

The American sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] published the essay ''American Architecture'' in August 1843 in which he rejected the imitation of old styles of buildings and outlined the functional relationship between architecture and decoration. These theories anticipated the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] in [[modern architecture]].

Towards the end of the century, there occurred a blossoming of theoretical activity. In England, Ruskin's ideals underpinned the emergence of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] exemplified by the writings of [[William Morris]]. This in turn formed the basis for [[Art Nouveau]] in the [[UK]], exemplified by the work of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], and influenced the [[Vienna Secession]]. On the Continent, the theories of [[Viollet-le-Duc]] and [[Gottfried Semper]] provided the springboard for enormous vitality of thought dedicated to architectural innovation and the renovation of the notion of style. Semper in particular developed an international following, in [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]]. The generation born during the middle-third of the 19th century was largely enthralled with the opportunities presented by Semper's combination of a breathtaking historical scope and a methodological granularity. In contrast to more recent, and thus "modern", thematically self-organized theoretical activities, this generation did not coalesce into a "movement." They did, however, seem to converge on Semper's use of the concept of ''Realismus'', and they are thus labelled proponents of [[architectural realism]]. Among the most active Architectural Realists were: [[Georg Heuser]], [[Rudolf Redtenbacher]], [[Constantin Lipsius]], [[Hans Auer]], [[Paul Sédille]], [[Lawrence Harvey]], [[Otto Wagner]] and [[Richard Streiter]].

===Twentieth century===


===Contemporary===
In contemporary architectural discourse theory has become more concerned with its position within culture generally, which is why university courses on architecture theory may often spend just as much time discussing philosophy and cultural studies as buildings. The notion that theory also entailed critique stemmed from post-structural [[literary studies]]. This, however, pushed architecture towards the notion of avant-gardism for its own sake - in many ways repeating the 19th century 'art for art's sake' outlook. Since 2000 this has materialised in architecture through concerns with the rapid rise of urbanism and [[globalization]], but also a pragmatic understanding that the city can no longer be a homogenous totality. Interests in fragmentation and architecture as transient objects further such thinking (e.g. the concern for employing high technology). And yet this can also be tied into general concerns such as [[ecology]], [[mass media]], and economism.

In the past decade, there has been a resurgence of the old "organic design" theories, but in a much more scientific setting. Several currents and design methodologies are being developed simultaneously, and some of these reinforce whereas others contrast with each other. One of these trends is [[Biomimicry]], which is the explicit copying of forms and structures found in biological organisms for buildings. Architects design organic-looking buildings in the belief that by copying nature, [[Organic architecture]] reaches a more attractive form. Another trend is the exploration of computational techniques, which are strongly influenced by algorithms relevant to biological processes. Trying to utilize [[Computational creativity]] in architecture, [[Genetic algorithms]] developed in computer science are applied to evolve designs on a computer, and some of these are proposed and built as actual structures. There exists, however, a controversy as to whether all such evolved designs through [[Design computing]] are truly appropriate for buildings, or are merely attractive forms that may be too complex for habitation. The new discipline of [[Biophilia]] developed by [[E. O. Wilson]] suggests the advantages of forms inspired by biological structures, but in a more profound way than simple mimicry. Wilson's original idea is extended by Stephen R. Kellert in the [[Biophilia hypothesis]], and applied to architectural design in the book "Biophilic Design". Mathematical features of biological forms such as [[fractals]], [[Scale-invariance]], very sophisticated notions of [[symmetry]], [[Self-similarity]], and complex [[Hierarchy]] are proposed as essential tools for designing architectural forms. Trying to understand the complex interaction between humans and their environment gained from [[Human-computer interaction]], [[Mobile robotics]], and [[Artificial intelligence]] leads to ideas in [[Intelligence-Based Design]]. We are witnessing a growth of new ideas that are generating an entirely new type of architectural theory. It bears little resemblance to the dominant school of architectural theory based on linguistic analysis, philosophy, post-structuralism, or cultural theory.
