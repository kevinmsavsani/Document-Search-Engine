In order to determine what is attack traffic, the system must be taught to recognise normal system activity. This can be accomplished in several ways, most often with [[artificial intelligence]] type techniques. Systems using [[neural networks]] have been used to great effect. Another method is to define what normal usage of the system comprises using a strict mathematical model, and flag any deviation from this as an attack. This is known as strict anomaly detection.
