The '''Apache License''' is a [[free software license]] authored by the [[Apache Software Foundation]] (ASF). The Apache License requires preservation of the [[copyright]] notice and [[disclaimer]], but it is not a [[copyleft]] license &mdash; it allows use of the source code for the development of [[proprietary software]] as well as [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]].


== Version history ==

The '''Apache License 1.0''' was the original Apache License which applies only to older versions of Apache packages (such as version 1.2 of the Web server).



== Licensing conditions ==

Like any [[free software license]], the Apache License allows the user of the software the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software, under the terms of the license.

The Apache License, like [[comparison of free software licenses | most other permissive licenses]], does not require [[Derivative work|modified versions]] of the software to be distributed using the same license (in contrast to [[copyleft]] licenses). In every licensed file, any original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices in redistributed code must be preserved (excluding notices that do not pertain to any part of the derivative works); and, in every licensed file changed, a notification must be added stating that changes have been made to that file.

If a NOTICE text file is included as part of the distribution of the original work, then derivative works must include a readable copy of these notices (again, excluding notices not pertaining to any part of the derivative work), in at least one of three places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the derivative works, within the source form or documentation, or within a display generated by the derivative works (wherever such third-party notices normally appear). The contents of the NOTICE file do not modify the license, as they are for informational purposes only, and adding more attribution notices as addenda to the NOTICE text is permissible, provided that these notices cannot be understood as modifying the license. Modifications may have appropriate copyright notices, and may provide different license terms for the modifications.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contributions submitted by a licensee to a licensor will be under the terms of the license without any terms and conditions, but this does not precede any separate agreements with the licensor regarding these contributions.
