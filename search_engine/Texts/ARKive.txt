'''ARKive''' is a global initiative to locate and gather [[films]], [[photographs]] and [[sound|audio]] [[recordings]] of the world's [[species]] into one centralised [[digital]] [[library]] for the benefit of present and future [[generations]]. As such, it is sometimes described as the new [[Noah’s Ark]], or the Noah’s Ark of the online era.

==History==

[[Image:David Attenborough.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[David Attenborough]] and the ARKive]]

He believed the records could be a powerful force in building environmental awareness by bringing [[scientific]] names to life. He also saw their [[film preservation|preservation]] as an important educational resource and conservation tool, not least because extinction rates and habitat destruction could mean that images and sounds might be the only legacy of some species’ existence.

His vision of a permanent, accessible, refuge for audio-visual wildlife material won almost immediate support from many of the world’s major broadcasters; leading film and photographic libraries, international conservation organisations and academic institutes. 


The ARKive project is an initiative of [[Wildscreen]], a UK-registered educational charity, based in [[Bristol]], and working globally to increase the public’s understanding and appreciation of biodiversity, through the power of wildlife imagery.
