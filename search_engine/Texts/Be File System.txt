The '''Be File System''' ('''BFS''', occasionally misnamed as BeFS â€” the name BeFS is used in the Linux kernel to avoid any confusion with [[Boot File System]]) is the native [[file system]] for the [[BeOS]].



Whilst intended as a 64-bit capable file system, the size of some on-disk structures mean that practical size limit is approximately 2 exabytes. Similarly the extent based file allocation reduces the maximum practical file size to approximately 260 gigabytes at best and as little as a few blocks in a pathological worst case, depending on the degree of [[file system fragmentation|fragmentation]].
