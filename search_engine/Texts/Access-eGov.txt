==Background, motivation==


==Access-eGov approach, objectives and solution==
The project objectives were defined on organisational and technological levels. Main ''organisational objective'' is to improve [[accessibility]] and [[connectivity]] of governmental services for citizens and businesses. ''Technical objectives'' are focused on the development of the [[software platform]] and tools for integration of various types of governmental services on a semantic basis, including a [[methodology]] for maintenance of the solution by public administrations.



==Pilot Applications==
===German field test – "Getting married" scenario===
The field test was carried out by Ministry of Finance of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. It was focused on the life event "marriage" and related procedures. The [[Registration of births, deaths and marriages|registry offices]] of eleven municipalities from Schleswig-Holstein have been involved in this field test. The main aim was to test the integration of different web resources containing the service information and making them accessible via a single platform but still leaving the data and its maintenance in the municipalities' legacy systems.

===Slovak pilot – "Obtaining a building permission" scenario===
The pilot application has been carried out by the [[Kosice Self-governing Region|Košice Self-Governing Region]] and the municipality of [[Michalovce]]. It was focused on supporting citizens during the process of obtaining a [[Building permit]], including complex services related to [[Land-use planning]] and approval proceedings. The objective was to make the whole process easier and transparent for citizens, to provide all relevant information about necessary services in a comprehensive and user-friendly way, and finally to improve the service from the citizen's point of view.

===Polish pilot – "Establishing an enterprise" scenario===
The pilot application took place in the Silesian region and was performed by the [[Gliwice]] City Hall. The user scenario involved four main user goals: registration in local government, registration in statistical office, registration in [[tax]] office and registration in [[Social insurance]] agency. The objective of the pilot application was to provide a single entry point where users (citizens and entrepreneurs) can obtain relevant information and are properly navigated by the system within the whole complex process.

==Project outcomes==
* Tools:
** ''Annotation tool'', which provides for public administration officers a capability to semantically annotate the resources as services, contact data, working hours, fees, etc. A set of forms and templates was designed for specification of preconditions and non-functional properties as parameters of the annotated government services, which can then be grouped into complex workflow sequences. The tool is designed as a standard web application, using the extended WSMO object model and [[JavaServer Faces|JSF]] technology.
** ''Personal Assistant client'', a tool that provides browsing, discovery, and execution capabilities of the services for citizens and businesses according to a specified life event or goal. Users can browse sub-goals and provide their answers when customization input is requested. Then the system automatically resolves the sub-goals and navigates the user to a new set of sub-goals and services inferred from the conceptual model. The electronic services provided via standardized [[Web Service]] interface can be directly invoked. Finally, the citizen obtains all available information on the life event customized to his/her case, and has also the possibility to execute the actions required for particular services needed for the accomplishing of the life event. The Personal Assistant client was implemented as a web application using [[JavaServer Faces|JSF]] technology. Layout, structure, and ordering of tabs in the interface are dynamically created from the annotated services and are customized according to the conditions of the given user.
