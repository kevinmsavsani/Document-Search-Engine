The functionality of the library includes support for basic 2D graphics, image manipulation, text output, audio output, midi music, input and timers, as well as additional routines for fixed-point and floating-point [[matrix (math)|matrix]] arithmetic, unicode strings, file system access, file manipulation, data files, and (limited, software-only) 3D graphics.

As of version 4.0, programs that use the library work on [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[BeOS]], [[Mac OS X]], and various [[Unix-like|Unix-like systems]] with (or without) [[X Window System]], abstracting their [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) into one portable interface. There is also an independent port of Allegro on [[AmigaOS 4]].

The library is written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and designed to be used with C or [[C++]]. It comes with extensive documentation and many examples.

==Addons==

The community of Allegro users have contributed several library extensions to handle things like scrolling tile maps and import and export of various file formats (e.g. [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[JPEG]] images, [[MPEG]] video, [[Ogg]], [[MP3]], [[Impulse Tracker|IT]], [[S3M (file format)|S3M]], [[XM (mod format)|XM music]], [[TrueType|TTF]] [[typeface|fonts]], and more). There are also bindings for several programming languages available, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]] and others.

Allegro can be used in conjunction with [[OpenGL]] by using the library ''AllegroGL'' which extends Allegro's functionality into OpenGL and therefore the hardware.

==History==


==Graphic functions==

* Vector drawing:
** pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, Bezier splines
** shape fill, with or without pattern
** polygons: flat, Gouraud, textured (3D) and translucent
* Sprites:
** masked, compressed and compiled sprites
** blitting, rotation, stretching, reduction, alpha blending, Gouraud shading
** native support for BMP, LBM, PCX and TGA files (others supported with library extensions)
* Color palettes:
** color palette manipulation (reading, writing, conversion)
* Text:
** support for different encodings and conversion, default is UTF-8
** bitmap fonts (masking, colouring, alignment)
* Misc:
** draw directly on the screen or on any-size memory bitmaps
** hardware scrolling and triple buffering (where available), mode-X split screen

==Allegro 5==

Current development is focused on the Allegro 5 branch, with the current version 5.0.0 (RC4). Allegro 5 is a complete redesign of the API and much of the internal operation of the library. An effort was made to make the API more consistent, and multi-thread safe. By default, the library will now be hardware accelerated using OpenGL or DirectX rendering backends where appropriate. Many of the addons that existed as separate projects for Allegro 4 will be rewritten to interface more seamlessly with Allegro proper and will be bundled with the default installation.

==Allegro X3==

The unknown Allegro project called Allegro X3 which started in 2003 was to introduce two new platforms (Xbox, PS2)
unfortunately the project was abandoned because of insufficient funds and other unknown matters in development.
