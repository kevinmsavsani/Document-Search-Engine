The A2100 satellite system was developed by a [[Skunk Works]] team at the Astro Space East Windsor, New Jersey facility.  A group of design Architects, including Brian Stewart, John Close, Pete Wise and Keith Davies delivered a flexible common bus with substantially fewer components, lower spacecraft weight, and reduced customer delivery time.  Jim Wilson led a team from GE's corporate r&d lab located in Niskayuna, NY, which helped with several technology underpinnings which advanced the A2100 design.



The A2100 series is modular and can be configured in different sizes: 

*A2100A = 1 to 4 [[kW]] 
*A2100AX = 4 to x kW 
*A2100AXS: enhanced A2100AX 
*A2100AXX : stretched version for mobile communications 
*Additionally there is an A2100M version, which fulfills military requirements.
