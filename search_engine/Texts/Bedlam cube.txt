== Design ==

The puzzle consists of thirteen [[polycube|polycubic]] pieces: twelve [[pentacubes]] and one [[tetracube]]. The objective is to assemble these pieces into a 4 x 4 x 4 cube. There are 19,186 distinct ways of doing so, excluding rotations and reflections.

Although the Bedlam cube is essentially just the logical next step up from the 3 x 3 x 3 [[Soma cube]], it is much more difficult to solve.

== History ==

Two of the BBC2 'dragons', [[Rachel Elnaugh]] and [[Theo Paphitis]], were to invest in the The Bedlam puzzle during the second series of "[[Dragons' Den]]".  They offered  £100,000 for a 30% share of equity in Bedlam Puzzles.  Danny Bamping (the entrepreneur behind Bedlam cube) finally chose a bank loan instead of their investment, as seen in the relevant "Where Are They Now" episode of "Dragons' Den".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
