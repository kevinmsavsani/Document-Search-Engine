AutoRun was introduced in [[Windows 95]] to ease application installation for non-technical users and reduce the cost of software support calls. When an appropriately configured [[CD-ROM]] is inserted into a CD-ROM drive, Windows detects the arrival and checks the contents for a special file containing a set of instructions. For a commercial application, these instructions normally initiate installation of the software from the CD-ROM. To maximise the likelihood of installation success, AutoRun also acts when the drive is accessed ("[[double-click]]ed") in [[Windows Explorer]] (or "My Computer").


== AutoRun ==



The terms AutoRun and AutoPlay tend to be interchangeably used when referring to the initiating action, the action that detects and starts reading from discovered [[volume (computing)|volume]]s. The [[AutoPlay#From detection to application|flowchart illustration]] in the AutoPlay article shows how AutoRun is positioned as a layer between AutoPlay and the Shell Hardware Detection service and may help in understanding the terminology. However, to avoid confusion, this article uses the term AutoRun when referring to the initiating action.

== AutoPlay ==

[[Image:AutoPlay.png|thumb|AutoPlay in [[Windows Vista]] ]]


AutoPlay is based on a set of handler applications registered with the AutoPlay system. Each media type (Pictures, Music, Video) can have a set of registered handlers which can deal with playing or display that type of media.

Each hardware device can have a default action occurring on discovery of a particular media type, or the AutoPlay dialog can prompt the user what action to take.

== AutoRun activation ==

The AutoRun sequence starts with the initial discovery of a new device or new piece of media. Following this, notification of interested parties occurs, of which the Windows Explorer shell is of primary interest. After checking certain [[Windows Registry|Registry]] settings to see if AutoRun can proceed, parsing of an optional autorun.inf may occur and any necessary actions are taken.(not working)

The initial sequence is handled much the same in every version of Windows from Windows 95. However, the way the autorun.inf file is read and acted upon and the level of integration of AutoRun with AutoPlay has changed significantly from the time AutoPlay was introduced in Windows XP until the present handling in [[Windows 7]].

=== Initiation and notification ===

When a device with AutoRun-compatible drivers receives new media, a "Media Change Notification" event occurs. The Windows [[operating system|OS]] then notifies interested applications that a device change has occurred. The notification method used can change depending on the device type.



An article on the CodeProject website, [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/HwDetect.aspx "Detecting Hardware Insertion and/or Removal"], with [http://blogs.msdn.com/doronh/archive/2006/02/15/532679.aspx clarifications] from a [[Weblog|blog]] by Doran Holan is of particular technical interest here.

Non-volume devices are those devices that do not appear as drive letters in "My Computer". These are not handled by any part of AutoRun - any actions taken for these devices are taken either by device specific software or by AutoPlay. See [[AutoPlay#Devices that are not drives]].








* takes no further action.
* invokes AutoPlay.

=== Changing behaviour ===

{{See also|autorun.inf#Inf handling}}

==== Before AutoPlay ====



The default Registry settings on Windows versions prior to Windows XP (See [[#NoDriveTypeAutoRun|NoDriveTypeAutoRun]]), disable Remote and Removable drives from AutoRun initiation, leaving Fixed and CDROM drive types active by default.

==== Introducing AutoPlay ====

With the introduction of AutoPlay in Windows XP, the final stage action (stage 7 above) for some drive types changed from executing an application to invoking AutoPlay. From Windows Vista, the AutoPlay system is integrated into every aspect of media handling and there is no automatic execution of the AutoRun task.

The default Registry settings add Removable drives to those that initiated AutoRun. In Windows XP and higher, ''except'' Windows Server 2003, only the Unknown and Remote drive types are not active for AutoRun.

The handling of the autorun.inf file changes very significantly between each Windows version. The details can be found in the [[autorun.inf#Inf handling|autorun.inf]] article. The current handling in Windows 7 is that ''only'' drives of type DRIVE_CDROM may specify an AutoRun task, alter double-click behaviour or change context menus.

=== The AutoPlay safety net ===

It would appear that AutoPlay, by transferring control of what were previously automatic and invisible actions to AutoPlay, acts to increase user control and safety. This applies especially from Windows Vista, where all media and devices fall under AutoPlay control.

However, it is important to note that:

* A user can instruct AutoPlay to make automatic choices on their behalf, including the execution of any AutoRun task.

* When a user double clicks on the drive icon in Explorer or right clicks to get a context menu, what happens next is fully programmable by the autorun.inf file and is essentially outside AutoPlay's purview. This is true under any Windows operating system.

* Disabling AutoRun may force a user to double click the drive icon to get a contents list, thus actually increasing the chance of malware infiltration.

== Registry settings ==

AutoRun consults [[Windows Registry]] values to decide whether to initiate actions for any particular drive or drive type. These values can be changed using several methods, one of which is using [[Group policy|Group Policy]].


=== Drive types ===


{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
! Type name        !!   Description
|-
| DRIVE_UNKNOWN    ||   The drive type cannot be determined
|-
| DRIVE_REMOVABLE  ||   The drive has removable media (floppy drive, [[USB flash drive]])
|-
| DRIVE_FIXED      ||   The disk cannot be removed from the drive (hard disk)
|-
| DRIVE_REMOTE     ||   The drive is a remote (network) drive
|-
| DRIVE_CDROM      ||   The drive is a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive
|-
| DRIVE_RAMDISK    ||   The drive is a [[RAM disk]]
|}

=== Registry terminology ===


The Windows Registry is a hierarchical [[directory (database)|database]] that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system. The terminology is somewhat misleading so it is briefly summarised here.

A Registry ''key'' is similar to a folder that, in addition to values, each key can contain subkeys which in turn may contain subkeys, and so on.

A Registry ''value'' consists of a name-data pair. Microsoft documentation commonly uses the term "entry" as an equivalent term. It also uses "value" for "data" when it is obvious what is meant. To avoid confusion, this article always uses the term "entry" when referring to the name-data pair.


=== Changing Registry settings ===



It may be necessary to either logout or restart the computer in order for any Registry changes to take effect.

=== Evaluation order ===



Thus in the following example:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
! colspan="2" | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE     !! colspan="2" | HKEY_CURRENT_USER
|-
! NoDriveAutoRun !! NoDriveTypeAutoRun !! NoDriveAutoRun  !! NoDriveTypeAutoRun
|-
|}


=== NoDriveTypeAutoRun ===

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !! Data type !! Range !! Default
|-
|}


The entry data is a bitmapped value, where a bit set to 1 disables AutoRun on a particular type of drive. The bit settings for each type of drive are shown below:

:[[Image:NoDriveTypeAutoRun bit settings.gif|none|drive type bitwise settings]]

Note that bit number 1 is unused and that the "Unknown" type is represented twice. Setting all bits to 1 would give a hexadecimal value of 0xFF, decimal 255, and would disable AutoRun on all types of drives.


{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
! Operating system      !!  Default setting
|-
|-
|-
|-
|-
|-
|-
|}

=== NoDriveAutoRun ===

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !! Data type !!  Range  !! Default
|-
|}


The data is a 32 bit (DWORD) bitmapped value, of which the lower 26 bits are used to represent each of the 26 drive letters from A to Z. Thus the valid data range is from 0x0 to 0x03FFFFFF. The least significant bit (the right most bit) represents drive A, and the 26th bit from the right represents drive Z.

A bit set to 1 disables AutoRun on a particular drive. For example, if the data value is set to 0x8 (1000 binary), AutoRun is disabled on drive D.

== Group Policy ==

[[Image:Group Policy Turn off Autoplay.gif|thumb|The Group Policy settings dialog]]



The policy names, locations and possible settings vary slightly between Windows versions. The list of settings are relatively short and are always additional to the system default setting. Therefore, on Windows 2000, enabling the "Disable Autoplay" policy and setting it to "CD-ROM drives", disables AutoRun (as distinct from AutoPlay) for CD-ROM and DVD drives, removable drives, network drives, and drives of unknown type.

This setting cannot be used to enable AutoRun on drives on which it is disabled by default or disable AutoRun for drives not listed. To disable or enable any particular drives or drive types, the Registry must be edited manually.

=== Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 ===

The per-machine policy location is:
: Group Policy \ Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ System

The per-user policy location is:
: Group Policy \ User Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ System

The relevant policy is "Turn off Autoplay". In Windows 2000 the policy is called "Disable Autoplay" instead.

Once the policy is Enabled it can be set to "All drives" or "CD-ROM drives". The latter setting adds CD-ROM drives to the existing list of disabled drive types as described above.

=== Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 ===

: Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ Autoplay Policies

The per-user policy location is:
: User Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ AutoPlay Policies

The relevant policy is "Turn off Autoplay" and can be set for CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and removable drives or all drives.


{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !! Data type !! Range !! Default
|-
|}

Sets the default behavior for AutoRun commands found in autorun.inf files.

Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun.inf specifying an AutoRun task was inserted, the default action was to automatically execute the program without user intervention. From Windows Vista the default behaviour is to invoke AutoPlay and represent the AutoRun task as one of the dialog options. This is also the behaviour when this policy is Not configured or Disabled.

If this policy is Enabled, the behaviour can be changed to either:
* Completely disable autorun.inf commands ''or''
* Automatically execute the autorun.inf command as per previous Windows versions.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !! Data type !! Range !! Default
|-
|}

If this policy is Enabled, the "Always do this..." checkbox in the AutoPlay dialog will not be set by default when the dialog is shown.

=== Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 ===


{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !! Data type !! Range !! Default
|-
|}

If this policy is enabled, AutoPlay will be disabled for [[AutoPlay#Devices that are not drives|non-volume]] devices.

== Altering AutoRun behaviour ==
=== Pressing the Shift key ===


Given that Shift must be held down until Windows checks for it, it may be a considerable amount of time before it becomes effective. The time taken primarily depends on the time to recognise the new hardware and the time taken for CD-ROMs to spin up. It is unsafe to rely on this method.

=== Auto Insert Notification ===

Certain [[#Initiation and notification|Media Change Notification]] events may be suppressed by altering certain Registry entries. "Media Change Notification" is the generic term; for CD-ROM drives, the specific term is "Auto Insert Notification".

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !! Data type !! Range !! Default
|-
|}


{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
! Data value  !!  Meaning
|-
|-
|}

Under Windows 95/98/ME, this setting can be changed under Device Manager, accessible from the System icon in Control Panel.

[[Image:Win98 devmgr ain.png|thumb|Auto insert notification under Windows 98]]

Although the Registry entry is named "AutoRun", it only suppresses the MCN message. The MCN message does trigger AutoRun initiation but it also instructs the Explorer shell to update its views and contents.

Thus, as a side effect only, this disables AutoRun for CD-ROM drives. However, Explorer will now not update its view when a new CD is inserted; it will show the contents of the previous CD until {{keypress|F5}} is pressed or View/Refresh is selected from the Explorer menu. This could result in severe confusion for users.

For this reason the Media Change Notification message should not be disabled unless there is absolutely no alternative; AutoRun can be disabled for individual drives using Group Policy or the Registry.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !!  Data type
|-
| REG_MULTI_SZ 
|}


The default value for this entry consists of products identified by Microsoft testing as being unable to support AutoRun. This entry should not be altered from its default.

=== Editing Group Policy ===


However, Group Policy would be the accepted method of disabling AutoRun on an entire Windows domain.

=== Registry files ===

A Registry setting file can be created that, when executed, makes the desired changes in the Registry.

{| style="font-size:90%; margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer]
"NoDriveTypeAutoRun"=dword:000000ff


|}

In the above example, AutoRun would be disabled for all drives and for all users. This example would need to be run as Administrator and a reboot would be needed for the setting to take complete effect.

=== Initialization file mapping ===



{| style="font-size:90%; margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\Autorun.inf]
@="@SYS:DoesNotExist"

|}

As this key does not exist, it is as if the autorun.inf file contains no settings information. It is important to note that this applies to any autorun.inf in any location and on any drive.

Both the policy setting and this workaround have the drawback is that installation of software from an autorunning install CD or DVD is no longer automatic. It will be necessary to view the CD's autorun.inf file and then execute the appropriate install program manually.

== Issues and security ==
=== The AutoRun disable bug ===


When AutoRun is disabled, Windows should not proceed further through the [[#AutoRun activation|activation]] sequence than the Registry check. However, it parses any autorun.inf found and does everything except the final action to invoke AutoPlay or execute an application.

This leaves the user open to attack from malware which uses the autorun.inf to alter the double-click and contextual menu behaviours. Double clicking the drive icon will infect the machine. Right Clicking and selecting the "Explore" or "Open" options from the context menu is not a workaround as these menu items can be coopted by the appropriate autorun.inf entries.


=== Other issues ===




: Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options



This Group Policy setting reflects the value of the Registry entry:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.5em 1em 1.5em 2em;"
|-
|-
! Entry name !! Data type !! Range !! Default
|-
|}

and should be set to 0.



=== Attack vectors ===

AutoRun functionality has been used as a malware vector for some time. Prior to Windows Vista, the default action with a CD-ROM drive type was to follow any autorun.inf file instructions without prompts or warnings. This makes rogue CD-ROMs one possible infection vector.

In the same category are mixed content CD-ROMs. An audio CD, that a user would not expect to contain software at all, can contain a data section with an autorun.inf. Some companies, such as [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal|Sony BMG]], have used this vector to install software that attempts to protect against copying of the audio tracks.

[[U3]] enabled flash drives, by [[Emulator|emulating]] a CD-ROM unit, can also cause Windows to execute commands from the autorun.inf found on the emulated CD-ROM.

Devices like the [[Huawei E220]] HSDPA modem, validly use this method to autoinstall drivers for the modem itself. However plugging in a flash drive from an unknown source is an unwise move. [http://wiki.hak5.org/wiki/USB_Switchblade USB Switchblade], and other similar tools, have made U3 flash drive attacks trivial. Given the ease of writing [[scripting language|script]] based attacks, [[anti-virus]] software may be ineffective in preventing data and password stealing.

[[Image:Conficker worm AutoPlay Vista.png|thumb|Social Engineering: The [[Conficker]] worm [http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=5695 in action] ]]

With a standard flash drive, social engineering attacks can be employed to entice a user to click on the appropriate item in the AutoPlay dialog. An alluring [[autorun.inf#%5bautorun%5d|action]] string promising free games or pornography would lure many users into the trap. At any time, double clicking on the drive icon will use the autorun.inf automatically, a trap more advanced users could fall into.

Any user can configure AutoPlay to make various decisions for them; by checking the appropriate box in the AutoPlay dialog, running flash drive malware becomes silent and automatic.


=== Attack mitigation ===

* following the [[principle of least privilege]] by not habitually running with [[Superuser|Administrator]] privileges and
* applying all relevant security patches and updates,
exposure to these attacks can be minimised through the appropriate use of Group Policy and Registry settings. The following security policies are a summary of those described within this article:

* Disable AutoRun (but see the [[#The AutoRun disable bug|AutoRun disable bug]])
* Use the "Default behavior for AutoRun" Group Policy under Vista (see [[#Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008|above]]) to disable autorun.inf commands
* Use [[#Initialization file mapping|initialization file mapping]] to nullify autorun.inf sections

In addition, the following actions have been recommended by Microsoft, primarily during the [[Conficker]] worm attacks:

*# Deleting any existing autorun.inf file from the root of a mapped network drive
*# Denying Create rights to the root of a mapped network drive
* Prevent the use of USB storage devices by means of:
** USB settings within the [[BIOS|System BIOS]]
