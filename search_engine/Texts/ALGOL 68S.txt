==Implementations==

[[Charles H. Lindsey]] has another ALGOL 68 implementation called ALGOL 68S for [[Sun3]], Sun [[Sparc]] (under [[SunOS]] 4.1), Sun Sparc (under [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 2), [[Atari ST]] (under [[Atari ST|GEMDOS]]) and [[Acorn Archimedes]] (under [[RISCOS]]), c.f. [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl#ALGOL%2068]

==Chief differences from ALGOL 68==
* no '''union'''
* no '''flex''' but '''string'''s are handled specially
* no arrays inside structures (but references to arrays would be allowed) and a similar restriction on arrays of arrays (multidimensional arrays are nonetheless permitted)
* limitations on use of '''long''' and '''short''' to facilitate implementation on small computers
* no '''heap'''
* no parallel processing
* restrictions on the order of declaration and other small syntactic differences to make single pass compilation possible
* no '''format'''s
