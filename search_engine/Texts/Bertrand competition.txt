The model rests on the following assumptions:

* There are at least two firms producing [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] (undifferentiated) products; 
* Firms do not cooperate;
* Firms compete by setting prices simultaneously; 
* Consumers buy everything from a firm with a lower price. If all firms charge the same price, consumers randomly select among them.

== Calculating the classic Bertrand model ==
*MC = Marginal cost

*Because firm 2 has the same marginal cost as firm 1, its reaction function is symmetrical with respect to the 45 degree line. Diagram 2 shows both reaction functions.

Another way of thinking about it, a simpler way, is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost, firms would get half the market at a higher than MC price. However, by lowering prices just slightly, a firm could gain the whole market, so both firms are tempted to lower prices as much as they can. It would be irrational to price below marginal cost, because the firm would make a loss. Therefore, both firms will lower prices until they reach the MC limit.

== Implications ==
* Note that [[collusion|colluding]] to charge the [[monopoly]] price and supplying one half of the market each is the best that the firms could do in this set up. However not colluding and charging [[marginal cost]], which is the non-cooperative outcome is the only [[Nash equilibrium]] of this model.

* If one firm has lower average cost (a superior [[production function|production technology]]), it will charge the highest price that is lower than the average cost of the other one (i.e. a price ''just'' below the lowest price the other firm can manage) and take all the business. This is known as [[limit price|"limit pricing"]]

== Bertrand competition versus [[Cournot competition]]==
* Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level; a duopoly will result in an outcome exactly equivalent to what prevails under perfect competition.

* Neither model is necessarily "better." The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry, depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation.

* If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is generally a better model of duopoly competition. Or, if output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.

* Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two stage model, where in the first stage firms choose capacities, and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion.

== Critical analysis of the Bertrand model ==
* The classic Bertrand model assumes firms compete purely on price, ignoring non-price competition. Firms can [[product differentiation|differentiate]] their products and charge a higher price. For example, would someone travel twice as far to save 1% on the price of their vegetables? The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result - that price is driven down to marginal cost - no longer holds.

* The model ignores capacity constraints. If a single firm does not have the capacity to supply the whole market then the "price equals marginal cost" result may not hold.

* The classical model only focuses on the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. There are mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits (see Kaplan & Wettstein, 2000, and Baye & Morgan, 1999).

* The classical model ignores search cost of consumers. If the consumer does not know the price of the product before visiting a firm and each visit is costly (however small), then a Nash equilibrium price will not arise. This creates the possibility that firms will randomly price at some point between marginal cost and the monopoly price.
