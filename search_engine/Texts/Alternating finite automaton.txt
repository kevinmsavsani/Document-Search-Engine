In [[automata theory]], an '''alternating finite automaton''' (AFA) is a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] whose transitions are divided into ''[[existential quantification|existential]]'' and ''[[universal quantification|universal]]'' transitions. For example, let ''A'' be an alternating [[automaton]].


Note that due to the universal quantification a run is represented by a run ''tree''. ''A'' accepts a word ''w'', if there ''exists'' a run tree on ''w'' such that ''every'' path ends in an accepting state.


This clause representation is usually more efficient.
