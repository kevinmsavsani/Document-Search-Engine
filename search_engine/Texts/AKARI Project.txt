The members of the AKARI Project come from NICT and some other famous universities or companies such as [[Tokyo University]], [[Keio University]], [[Osaka University]], [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] and NTT etc. So far they have produced a Conceptual Design Book, which describes their philosophy to pursue an ideal solution by researching new network architectures from a clean slate without being impeded by existing constraints. They have identified three major design principles as: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), Sustainable and Evolutionary, and Reality Connection. 

To some extent, the AKARI Project is similar to the [[Global Environment for Network Innovations]] ('''GENI''') facility of USA and the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) of EU. As a matter of fact, there are strong relationships among all these projects.
