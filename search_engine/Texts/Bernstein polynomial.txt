In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[numerical analysis]], a '''Bernstein polynomial''', named after [[Sergei Natanovich Bernstein]], is a [[polynomial]] in the '''Bernstein form''', that is a [[linear combination]] of '''Bernstein basis polynomials'''.

A [[numerical stability|numerically stable]] way to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form is [[de Casteljau's algorithm]].

Polynomials in Bernstein form were first used by Bernstein in a constructive proof for the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem|Stone–Weierstrass approximation theorem]]. With the advent of computer graphics, Bernstein polynomials, restricted to the interval ''x'' ∈ [0, 1], became important in the form of [[Bézier curve]]s.

==Definition==

The ''n'' + 1 '''Bernstein basis polynomials''' of degree ''n'' are defined as




A linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials 



==Example==
The first few Bernstein basis polynomials are:

\begin{align}
b_{0,0}(x) & = 1, \\
b_{0,1}(x) & = 1 - x, & b_{1,1}(x) & = x \\
b_{0,2}(x) & = (1 - x)^2, & b_{1,2}(x) & = 2x(1 - x), & b_{2,2}(x) & = x^2 \\
b_{0,3}(x) & = (1 - x)^3, & b_{1,3}(x) & = 3x(1 - x)^2, & b_{2,3}(x) & = 3x^2(1 - x), & b_{3,3}(x) & = x^3  \\
b_{0,4}(x) & = (1 - x)^4, & b_{1,4}(x) & = 4x(1 - x)^3, & b_{2,4}(x) & = 6x^2(1 - x)^2, & b_{3,4}(x) & = 4x^3(1 - x), & b_{4,4}(x) & = x^4
\end{align}

==Properties==
The Bernstein basis polynomials have the following properties:

* The [[derivative]] can be written as a combination of two polynomials of lower degree:



* A Bernstein polynomial can always be written as a linear combination of polynomials of higher degree:

==Approximating continuous functions==
Let ''&fnof;'' be a [[continuous function]] on the interval [0, 1]. Consider the Bernstein polynomial


It can be shown that 


[[uniform convergence|uniformly]] on the interval [0, 1].  This is a stronger statement than the proposition that the limit holds for each value of ''x'' separately; that would be [[pointwise convergence]] rather than [[uniform convergence]]. Specifically, the word ''uniformly'' signifies that


Bernstein polynomials thus afford one way to prove the [[Stone&ndash;Weierstrass theorem#Weierstrass_approximation_theorem|Weierstrass approximation theorem]] that every real-valued continuous function on a real interval [''a'', ''b''] can be uniformly approximated by polynomial functions over '''R'''.

A more general statement for a function with continuous k-th derivative is


where additionally



===Proof===

Suppose ''K'' is a [[random variable]] distributed as the number of successes in ''n'' independent [[Bernoulli trial]]s with probability ''x'' of success on each trial; in other words, ''K'' has a [[binomial distribution]] with parameters ''n'' and ''x''.  Then we have the [[expected value]] E(''K''/''n'') = ''x''.

By the [[law of large numbers|weak law of large numbers]] of [[probability theory]],
for every ''&delta;'' > 0. Moreover, this relation holds uniformly in ''x'', which can be seen from its proof via [[Chebyshev's inequality]], taking into account that the variance of ''K''/''n'', equal to ''x''(1-''x'')/''n'', is bounded from above by 1/(4''n'') irrespective of ''x''.

Because ''&fnof;'', being continuous on a closed bounded interval, must be [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] on that interval, one infers a statement of the form
uniformly in ''x''. Taking into account that ''ƒ'' is bounded (on the given interval) one gets for the expectation
uniformly in ''x''. To this end one splits the sum for the expectation in two parts. On one part the difference does not exceed ε; this part cannot contribute more than ε.
On the other part the difference exceeds ε, but does not exceed 2''M'', where ''M'' is an upper bound for |''ƒ''(x)|; this part cannot contribute more than 2''M'' times the small probability that the difference exceeds ε.
