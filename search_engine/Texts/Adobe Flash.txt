Flash manipulates [[vector graphics|vector]] and [[raster graphics]] to provide animation of text, drawings, and still images. It supports bidirectional [[Streaming media|streaming]] of audio and video, and it can capture user input via mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera. Flash contains an [[Object-oriented language]] called [[ActionScript]].

Flash content may be displayed on various computer systems and [[information appliance|devices]], using [[Adobe Flash Player]], which is available free of charge for common [[web browser]]s, some [[mobile phone]]s and a few other [[electronic device]]s (using [[Flash Lite]]).

===Recent developments===

'''Adobe Labs''' (previously called ''Macromedia Labs'') is a source for news and pre-release versions of emerging products and technologies from Adobe. Most innovations, such as Flash 10, [[Macromedia Flex|Flex]] 3, and ActionScript 3.0 have all been discussed and/or trialled on the site.




====Open Screen Project====



==Format==
{{main|SWF}}

The use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller — and thus for streams to use less [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] — than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips. For content in a single format (such as just text, video, or audio), other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less [[central processing unit|CPU]] power than the corresponding Flash movie, for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades.

In addition to a vector-rendering engine, the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) for scripting interactivity at run-time, support for video, MP3-based audio, and bitmap graphics. As of Flash Player 8, it offers two video codecs: [[On2 Technologies]] [[VP6]] and [[sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]], and run-time support for [[JPEG]], Progressive JPEG, [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]]. In the next version, Flash is slated to use a [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] compiler for the ActionScript engine.

Flash Player is a browser plugin, and cannot run within a usual e-mail client, such as [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]]. Instead, a link must open a browser window. A [[Gmail]] labs feature allows playback of YouTube videos linked in emails.

===Flash Video===
{{Main|Flash Video}}
Virtually all browser plugins for video are [[Gratis#Software|free of charge]] and cross-platform, including Adobe's offering of Flash Video, which was first introduced with Flash version 6. Flash Video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large [[#Installed user base|installed user base]] and programmability of Flash. In 2010, Apple [[#Criticism|publicly criticized]] Adobe Flash, including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration, one reason Flash is not to be found on Apple's mobile devices. Soon after Apple's criticism, Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10.1, which takes advantage of GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac. Flash 10.2 beta, released December 2010, finally adds multicore CPU hardware acceleration for h.264, three years after most other decoders.

===Flash Audio===
Flash Audio is most commonly encoded in [[MP3]] or AAC ([[Advanced Audio Coding]]) however it does also support [[ADPCM]], Nellymoser ([[Nellymoser Asao Codec]]) and [[Speex]] audio codecs. Flash allows sample rates of 11, 22 and 44.1 kHz. It does not support 48 kHz audio sample rate which is the standard TV, DVD sample rate.

|publisher=Adobe

Adobe Flash Player 10.1 does not support acoustic echo cancellation, unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice. This makes Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings, as use of headphones for all participants is essential, or at least highly advised.

===Disclosure===
In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification to the world on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's [[Xara Flare|Flare]] and Sharp's [[Extended Vector Animation]] formats. Several developers quickly created a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[C library|library]] for producing SWF. In February 1999, the company introduced [[MorphInk]] 99, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired [[Middlesoft]] to create a freely available [[development kit|developers' kit]] for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5.

Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a [[non-disclosure agreement]], but they are widely available from various sites.

====History====

In December 1996, [[Macromedia]] bought FutureWave and so re-branded and released FutureSplash Animator as ''Macromedia Flash'' v1.0. In 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia; subsequently, in 2007, ''Adobe Flash CS3 Professional'', the next version of Macromedia Flash was released.

===Third-party tools===
[[Open Source]] projects like [[Ajax framework|Ajax Animator]] and the (now defunct) [[UIRA]] aim to create a Flash development environment, complete with a graphical user environment. Alternatively, programs such as [[swfmill]], [[SWFTools]], and [[MTASC]] provide tools to create SWF files, but do so by compiling text, actionscript or XML files into [[Flash animation]]s. It is also possible to create SWF files programmatically using the [[Ming library]], which has interfaces for [[C (Programming Language)|C]], [[PHP]], [[C++]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. [[haXe]] is an open source, high-level object-oriented programming language geared towards web-content creation that can compile Flash files.

Many [[shareware]] developers produced Flash creation tools and sold them for under US$50 between 2000 and 2002. In 2003 competition and the emergence of free Flash creation tools had driven many third-party Flash-creation tool-makers out of the market, allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices, although many of the products still cost less than US$100 and support ActionScript. As for open source tools, [[KToon]] can edit vectors and generate SWF, but its interface is very different from Macromedia's. Another, more recent example of a Flash creation tool is [[SWiSH Max]] made by an ex-employee of Macromedia. [[ToonBoom|Toon Boom]] Technologies also sells a traditional animation tool, based on Flash.

In addition, several programs create [[.swf]]-compliant files as output from their programs. Among the most famous of these are [[Screencast]] tools, which leverage the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content in order to produce demos, tutorials, or software simulations of programs. These programs are typically designed for use by non-programmers, and create Flash content quickly and easily, but cannot actually edit the underlying Flash code (i.e. the tweening and transforms, etc.) [[Screencam]] is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt Flash as the preferred output format, having been developed since the mid-90s. The fact that screencasting programs have adopted Flash as the preferred output is testament to Flash's presence as a ubiquitous cross-platform animation file format.

Other tools are focused on creating specific types of Flash content. [[Anime Studio]] is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation which creates SWF files. [[Express Animator]] is similarly aimed specifically at animators. [[Question Writer]] publishes its quizzes to Flash file format.

Users who are not programmers or web designers will also find on-line tools that allow them to build full Flash-based websites. One of the oldest services available (1998) is [http://www.flashtogo.com/ FlashToGo]. Such companies provide a wide variety of pre-built models (templates) associated to a Content Management System that empowers users to easily build, edit and publish their websites. Other sites, that allows for greater customization and design flexibility are [[Wix.com]] and [[CirclePad]].

Adobe wrote a software package called [[Adobe LiveMotion]], designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats, including SWF. LiveMotion went through two major releases, but failed to gain any notable user base.

In February 2003, Macromedia purchased Presedia, which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash. Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze, which included many new enhancements. In addition, (as of version 2) [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]] presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to SWF.

The Adobe Flash Player exists for a variety of systems and devices: Windows, [[Mac OS 9]]/[[Mac OS X|X]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[Pocket PC]]/[[Windows CE]], [[OS/2]], [[QNX]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Symbian]], [[Palm OS]], [[BeOS]], and [[IRIX]], although the performance is typically best on Windows (see [[#Performance|Performance]]). For compatibility with devices (embedded systems), see [[Macromedia Flash Lite]].

[[File:Noflash.png|thumb|Some websites rely on Flash so heavily that they are totally unusable without this plugin]]


Downloading Flash is blocked in countries that are under U.S [[economic sanction|sanctions]] (such as Syria & Sudan). Users in these countries are blocked (by Adobe) from downloading Flash plug-ins for both Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==64-bit support==


The key new capabilities in the Flash Player "Square" preview are:
* 64-bit support — Native support for 64-bit operating systems and 64-bit web browsers on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. (Hulu and Amazon which depends on RTMPE are not currently functioning because there are some 64-bit libs that need to be integrated into the branch{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/738761?tstart=0|title=Adobe Forums: Flash Player "Square": 64-bit}})
* Internet Explorer 9 hardware accelerated rendering support — Enhanced support for Internet Explorer 9 Beta. It takes advantage of hardware accelerated graphics in Internet Explorer 9 Beta, utilizing hardware rendering surfaces to improve graphics performance and enable seamless composition.





==Usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
One of the uses of Adobe Flash is to create a '''flash intro''', a piece of animated content displayed at the beginning of a [[website]]. Often, the main content is loading in the background, while the animated content is displayed in the foreground. The intent is to captivate the user's attention so that he or she does not stray from the site, although it may do the opposite as it slows the user from accessing the actual site and can be tedious for users with slow internet connections. Often a "skip" or "skip intro" button is prepared to allow more immediate access to the site's homepage.

==Alternatives to Flash==
===HTML5===
{{main|HTML5 vs. Flash}}


===Microsoft Silverlight===

===Java===
[[Java applet]]s are used both to create interactive visualisations and to present video, three dimensional objects and other media. Java applets are more appropriate for complex visualizations that require significant programming effort in high level language or communications between applet and originating server. Sun's new [[JavaFX]] is considered as another competitor for [[Rich Internet Applications]].

===Other open alternatives===
{{See also|Open format}}

There are equivalent open standards for many simple uses of Flash. Most notably the [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] file formats, the ''canvas'', ''audio'' and ''video'' HTML elements, and the [[JavaScript]] programming language. More complex use cases can be achieved by combining these.



===Third-party players===


There is, as of late 2008, no complete free software replacement which offers all the functionality of the latest version of Adobe Flash Player.

[[Swfdec]] is another open-source flash player available for Linux, [[FreeBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]]. See also SWFOpener.

[[Lightspark]] is a new implementation aiming to create a more modern and fast player. Besides hardware-accelerated rendering, it exploits [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] and [[JIT compilation]]. It supports only the new [[ActionScript#ActionScript 3.0|ActionScript 3]] [[Virtual Machine|VM]] introduced in Flash 9.



[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/flvstreamer flvstreamer] is an open source software implementation of an RTMP client, Flash's own streaming protocol. It is a fork of rtmpdump which has all the cryptographic support (i.e. RTMPE and SWF verification) removed from the code.

[http://smokescreen.us Smokescreen] allows playback of Flash files using javascript in the webpage.
