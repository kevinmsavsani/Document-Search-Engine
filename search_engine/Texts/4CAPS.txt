==Overview and Assumptions==
In 4CAPS computations are distributed and dynamically balanced among independent processing centers.  Like in other cognitive architectures (e.g., [[ACT-R]]), these processing centers have been identified with corresponding cortical regions in the human brain.  Performing  specific task, such as reading or driving, requires the simultaneous contribution of many of such regions.


# Each cortical area can perform multiple cognitive functions
# Each cortical area has a limited capacity of computational resources
# The cortical network of regions that is responsible for carrying out a particular task changes dynamically as the regions' capacity resources are saturated.
# Communications between cortical regions is also subject to specific constraints, similar to bandwidth limitations along information channels.
