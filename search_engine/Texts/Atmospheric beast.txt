==In astrobiological speculation==

==In cryptozoology and fringe research==
Atmospheric beasts also appear in [[cryptozoology]] and [[UFO]]-related contexts. Through [[ufology]] history, many authors wondered if the purported spaceships they were allegedly investigating could be some kind of animals living in [[Earth's atmosphere]].


==In fiction==
Atmospheric creatures on [[Earth]] have served as the premise of several [[science-fiction]] stories since the early 20th century, though all of these refer to atmospheric beasts on Earth, not the Sagan hypothesis of creatures living in the atmospheres of gas giants.

The first occurrence of such creatures in science fiction was in [[Will A. Page]]'s 1911 short story "The Air Serpent", which, as the title implies, was about a flying, reptilian-looking creature. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] elaborated upon the idea in his 1913 story "[[The Horror of the Heights]]", which portrayed an entire ecosystem of semi-solid beasts living at previously undiscovered heights in the atmosphere, as did [[Ray Bradbury]] in ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]''.

[[Spider Robinson]]'s novel ''[[Telempath]]'' features such animals called "Muskys", which attacked the Earth when large amounts of [[pollution]] began to affect the air.

[[Kenneth Oppel]]'s ''[[Airborn]]'' series take place in an [[alternate history]] in which a number of atmospheric beasts exist.

[[James Blish]]'s ''[[Cities in Flight]]'' makes mention of a bioluminescent, jellyfish-like beast which exists as the only life form on the planet Jupiter, making its home strictly within the atmosphere.

The game [[Star Control II]] includes a race of balloon-like aliens called the "Slylandro", who are native to a distant gas giant, living only within a certain air density. While intelligent and long lived, they have little technology and no means of travelling beyond their planet, as all material beyond a certain density sinks to levels of their atmosphere they cannot survive in.

In the game [[City of Heroes]], Kheldians are energy beings that can bond with living creatures in a symbiotic relationship, and after generations are able to 'memorize' their 'host pattern' to transform to one of these species at will. One of the species they can transform into is a tentacled, squid-like creature that is said to have lived in the atmosphere of a gas giant.
