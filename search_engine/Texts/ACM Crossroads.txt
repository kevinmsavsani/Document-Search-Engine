==Makeover==
The magazine was originally titled "Crossroads" but in May 2010, it was given a makeover and the title was replaced by the pseudo-acronym "XRDS". Prior to the makeover, the format of the magazine is similar to that of its more illustrious cousin, the [[Communications of the ACM]] where articles are summaries of interesting research papers. With the Summer 2010 issue of XRDS, ACM inaugurates a completely revamped edition of the magazine. Targeted to both graduate and undergraduate students contemplating computing careers, the newly redesigned XRDS offers breaking news and information, practical career advice, and first-hand stories and profiles of people on the front lines of the burgeoning computing field.

The new magazine and its website http://XRDS.acm.org reflect the real voices of today’s students, and will create a hub of interaction and communication for them to access.

XRDS has been designed as an easy-access resource for students who are focused on their futures. Readers now have a convenient channel to find valuable content not only on their field of study but on the student experience as well. With the magazines’ new website, students now have a central place where they can share their ideas and experiences through interactive features and by submitting articles for publication.
