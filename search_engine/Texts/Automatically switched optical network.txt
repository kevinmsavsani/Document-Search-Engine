== The Need for ASON ==

* Fast and automatic end-to-end provisioning
* Fast and efficient re-routing
* Support of different clients, but optimized for [[Internet Protocol|IP]]
* Dynamic set up of connections
* Support of Optical [[Virtual Private Networks]] (OVPNs)
* Support of different levels of quality of service


== Logical Architecture of An ASON ==
[[Image:ASON Logical Architecture.jpg|thumb|Logical Architecture of ASON]]

The [[logical]] architecture of an ASON can be divided into 3 planes:
* Transport Plane
* Control Plane
* Management Plane

'''The Transport Plane''' contains a number of switches (optical or otherwise) responsible for transporting user data via connections. These switches are connected to each other via PI (Physical Interface).

'''The Control Plane''' is responsible for the actual resource and connection management within an ASN network. It consists of a series of OCC (Optical Connection Controllers), interconnected via NNIs (Network to Network Interfaces).  These OCCs have the following functions:
* [[Network topology]] discovery (resource discovery)
* Signaling, [[routing]], address assignment
* Connection set-up/tear-down
* Connection protection/restoration
* [[Traffic engineering]]
* Wavelength assignment
