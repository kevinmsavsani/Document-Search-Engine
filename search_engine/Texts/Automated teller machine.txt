An '''automated teller machine''' ('''ATM'''), also known as a '''automated banking machine''' ('''ABM''') or '''Cash Machine''' and by several other names (see below), is a computerised telecommunications device that provides the [[customer|clients]] of a [[financial institution]] with access to [[financial transaction]]s in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or [[bank teller]].

On most modern ATMs, the customer is identified by inserting a plastic [[ATM card]] with a [[magnetic stripe]] or a plastic [[smart card]] with a [[Integrated circuit|chip]], that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or [[Card Security Code|CVVC]] (CVV). Authentication is provided by the customer entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN).

The Barclays-De La Rue machine (called De La Rue Automatic Cash System or DACS) beat the [[List of banks in Sweden|Swedish saving banks’]] and a company called Metior's (a device called Bankomat) by nine days and [[National Westminster Bank|Westminster Bank’s]]-[[Smiths Group|Smith Industries]]-[[Chubb Locks|Chubb]] system (called Chubb MD2) by a month. The collaboration of a small start-up called Speytec and [[Midland Bank]] developed a third machine which was marketed after 1969 in Europe and the USA by the [[Burroughs Corporation]]. The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed on September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe & Malcom David Roe.

Both the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. Hence all this these worked on various principles including [[radiation|Carbon-14]] and
low-coercivity [[magnetism]] in order to make fraud more difficult. The idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a British


ATMs first came into use in December 1972 in the UK; the IBM 2984 was designed at the request of [[Lloyds Bank]]. The 2984 CIT (Cash Issuing Terminal) was the first true Cashpoint, similar in function to today's machines; Cashpoint is still a [[registered trademark]] of Lloyds TSB in the UK. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a US bank. Notable historical models of ATMs include the [[IBM 3624]] and [[IBM 473x|473x]] series, [[Diebold 10xx]] and [[TABS 9000]] series, and [[NCR 50xx]] series.

==Location==
[[Image:ATM pinpad in german.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM Encrypting PIN Pad (EPP) with [[German language|German]] markings]]

ATMs are placed not only near or inside the premises of banks, but also in locations such as shopping centers/malls, airports, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, or any place large numbers of people may gather. These represent two types of ATM installations: on and off premise. On premise ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement an actual bank branch's capabilities and thus more expensive. Off premise machines are deployed by financial institutions and also ISOs (or Independent Sales Organizations) where there is usually just a straight need for cash, so they typically are the cheaper mono-function devices. In Canada, when an ATM is not operated by a financial institution it is known as a [[White Label ATMs in Canada|"White Label ATM"]].

In North America, banks often have [[drive-thru]] lanes providing access to ATMs.

Many ATMs have a sign above them indicating the name of the bank or organization owning the ATM, and possibly including the list of ATM networks to which that machine is connected. This type of sign is called a ''topper''.

==Financial networks==
[[Image:Geldautomaat.jpg|thumb|right|An ATM in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[logo]]s of a number of [[interbank network]]s this ATM is connected to are shown.]]
Most ATMs are connected to [[interbank network]]s, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their account or in the country where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include [[Pulse (interbank network)|PULSE]], [[PLUS]], [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]], [[Interac]], Interswitch, [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]], and [[LINK (UK)|LINK]].

ATMs rely on [[authorization]] of a [[financial transaction]] by the card issuer or other authorizing institution via the communications network. This is often performed through an [[ISO 8583]] messaging system.

Many banks charge [[ATM usage fees]]. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank where the ATM is installed; in other cases, they apply to all users.

In order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilizes the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a [[scrip cash dispenser]].

[[Image:Diebold 1063 ATM with modem.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Diebold 1063]]ix with a dial-up modem visible at the base]]
[[File:Cash Machine in Trogir.JPG|thumb|ATM in Trogir, Croatia]]
ATMs typically connect directly to their host or [[ATMC|ATM Controller]] via either [[ADSL]] or dial-up [[modem]] over a [[telephone]] line or directly via a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to [[plain old telephone service|POTS]] lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Leased lines may be comparatively expensive to operate versus a POTS line, meaning less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet [[VPN]] connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] over [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]], [[TC500]] over [[Asynchronous communication|Async]], [[X.25]], and [[TCP/IP]] over [[Ethernet]].


==Global use==








In the [[Republic of Ireland]], ATMs are also commonly referred to as a "[[Banklink]]", named after the [[Allied Irish Bank]] brand of [[machine]]s.

In [[Israel]], ATMs are commonly referred to as "[[Kaspomat]]" ([[Hebrew]]: כספומט), which is a compound word meaning "automatic money" in [[Hebrew]], named after the [[Bank Leumi]] & [[Israel Discount Bank]] brand of [[machine]]s.

==Hardware==
[[Image:Atm blockdiagram.png|thumb|right|A block diagram of an ATM]]

An ATM is typically made up of the following devices:
* [[CPU]] (to control the user interface and transaction devices)
* [[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic]] and/or [[Chip card]] reader (to identify the customer)
* [[Personal identification number|PIN]] Pad (similar in layout to a [[Touch tone]] or [[Calculator]] keypad), often manufactured as part of a secure enclosure.
* [[Secure cryptoprocessor]], generally within a secure enclosure.
* Display (used by the customer for performing the transaction)
* [[Function key]] buttons (usually close to the display) or a [[Touchscreen]] (used to select the various aspects of the transaction)

* Record Printer (to provide the customer with a record of their transaction)
* [[Bank vault|Vault]] (to store the parts of the machinery requiring restricted access)
* Housing (for aesthetics and to attach signage to)

Recently, due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of computer-like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using [[microcontroller]]s and/or [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s to adopting the hardware architecture of a [[personal computer]], such as, USB connections for peripherals, ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems. Although it is undoubtedly cheaper to use [[commercial off-the-shelf]] hardware, it does make ATMs potentially vulnerable to the same sort of problems exhibited by conventional computers.

Business owners often lease ATM terminals from ATM service providers.

The vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. [[Scrip cash dispenser]]s do not incorporate a vault.

Mechanisms found inside the vault may include:
* Dispensing mechanism (to provide [[cash]] or other items of value)
* Deposit mechanism including a Check Processing Module and Bulk Note Acceptor (to allow the customer to make deposits)
* Security sensors (Magnetic, Thermal, Seismic, gas)
* Locks: (to ensure controlled access to the contents of the vault)
* Journaling systems; many are electronic (a sealed flash memory device based on proprietary standards) or a solid-state device (an actual printer) which accrues all records of activity including access timestamps, number of bills dispensed, etc. - This is considered sensitive data and is secured in similar fashion to the cash as it is a similar liability.



==Software==
[[Image:Atm os2warp.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Suncorp Metway]] ATM running [[OS/2]]]]
With the migration to commodity PC hardware, standard commercial "off-the-shelf" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include [[RMX (operating system)|RMX]] or [[OS/2]]. Today the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a [[Microsoft]] OS, primarily [[Windows XP Professional]] or [[Windows XP Embedded]].

A small number of deployments may still be running older versions such as [[Windows NT]], [[Windows CE]] or [[Windows 2000]]. Notably, [[Windows Vista|Vista]] was not widely adopted in ATMs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} There is a computer industry security view or consensus that desktop operating systems have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (Secure) Real Time Operating Systems ([[RTOS]]s). [[RISKS Digest]] has many articles about cash machine operating system vulnerabilities [http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/php/risks/search.php?query=cash+machine].

[[Image:Postomat-Windows-p1020441.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] ATM running [[Windows 2000]]]]
[[Linux]] is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is [[Banrisul]], the largest bank in the south of [[Brazil]], which has replaced the [[MS-DOS]] operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. [[Banco do Brasil]] is also migrating ATMs to Linux.



While the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's [[Write once run anywhere|"Write once, run anywhere"]] mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences between various platforms.

With the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATM's, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent.  This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications.  These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch.  It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and [[video banking]] systems.

Notable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, [[Diebold]] Agilis EmPower, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|APTRA Edge]], CR2 BankWorld, KAL Kalignite, Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, and [[Wincor Nixdorf]] [[Wincor Nixdorf|ProTopas]].


==Security==
[[Image:49024-SOS-ATM.JPG|thumb|right|A Triton brand ATM with a dip style card reader and a triple DES keypad]]
[[Security]], as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are dealt with.

===Physical===
[[Image:Procash stolen 1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] Procash 2100xe Frontload that was opened with an [[angle grinder]]]]


Modern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by means of techniques such as [[dye marker]]s and [[smoke canister]]s.

A common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.

===Transactional secrecy and integrity===
The security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure [[cryptoprocessor]]: the ATM often uses commodity components that are not considered to be "[[trusted system]]s".


===Customer identity integrity===

{{Clear}}

===Device operation integrity===
[[Image:Worn ATM.jpg|thumb|ATMs that are exposed to the outside must be vandal and weather resistant.]]
Openings on the customer-side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside the ATM and in ATM servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorized personnel.


===Customer security===
[[Image:ATMs In A Van.jpg|thumb|right|Dunbar Armored ATM Techs watching over ATMs that have been installed in a [[van]].]]


In 1998 three towns outside of Cleveland Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted ATM Consumer Security Legislation requiring that a 9-1-1 switch be installed at all outside ATMs within their jurisdiction.  Since the passing of these laws 11 years ago, there have been no repeat crimes.  In the wake of an ATM Murder in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, The City Council of Sharon Hill passed an ATM Consumer Security Bill as well, with the same result. As of July 2009, ATM Consumer Security Legislation is currently pending in New York, New Jersey, and Washington D.C.
In China, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive CCTV coverage, an emergency telephone and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that aren't guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping your bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify who enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.

===Alternative uses===
[[Image:Dual currency cash machines in Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Two NCR Personas 84 ATMs at a [[bank]] in [[Jersey]] dispensing two types of [[pound sterling]] banknotes: [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England notes]] on the left, and [[Jersey pound|States of Jersey notes]] on the right]]
Although ATMs were originally developed as just cash dispensers, they have evolved to include many other bank-related functions. In some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank ATM network (e.g.: [[Multibanco]] in Portugal), ATMs include many functions which are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as:
* Paying routine bills, fees, and taxes (utilities, phone bills, social security, legal fees, taxes, etc.)
* Printing [[bank statement]]s
* Updating [[passbook]]s
* Loading monetary value into [[stored value card]]s
* Purchasing
** [[Postage stamp]]s.
** [[Lottery]] tickets
** [[Public transport#Ticket systems|Train tickets]]
** Concert tickets
** Movie tickets
** [[Shopping mall]] [[gift certificate]]s.
* Fastloans
* CRM at the ATM
* Cheque Processing Module
* Adding pre-paid [[cell phone]] / [[mobile phone]] credit.
* Paying (in full or partially) the credit balance on a card linked to a specific [[current account]].

Increasingly banks are seeking to use the ATM as a sales device to deliver pre approved loans and targeted advertising using products such as ITM (the Intelligent Teller Machine) from CR2 or Aptra Relate from NCR.


[[Image:ATM with various function.JPG|thumb|right|A [[South Korea]]n ATM with mobile bank port and [[bar code reader]]]]Manufacturers have demonstrated and have deployed several different technologies on ATMs that have not yet reached worldwide acceptance, such as:
* On-demand printing of "items of value" (such as movie tickets, [[traveler's cheque]]s, etc.)
* Dispensing additional media (such as phone cards)

==Reliability==
[[Image:DeLaRue ATM Crash.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM running [[Microsoft Windows]] that has [[blue screen of death|crashed]]]]



This said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[banknote]] being loaded in the money cassettes. Errors that can occur may be [[Machine|mechanical]] (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; [[hard disk failure]]s); [[software]] (such as [[operating system]]; [[device driver]]; [[application software|application]]); [[information transfer|communications]]; or purely down to operator error.
[[Image:ATM OS2 Crash.jpg|thumb|right|An ATM running [[OS/2]] that has crashed]]
To aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows both the users of the ATMs and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.


==Fraud==
As with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.





===Card fraud===
[[Image:ATM lineup on ground.jpg|thumb|right|ATM lineup]]
[[Image:ATM Masalli.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|A big queue at an ATM in [[Masalli]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]
In an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[Personal identification number|PIN]]s, some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.

For a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account.

[[Image:Tamper warning on ATM in London.jpg|thumb|left|Some ATMs may put up warning messages to customers to not use them when it detects possible [[Tampering (crime)|tampering]]]]









==Related devices==
A [[Talking ATM]] is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that persons who cannot read an ATM screen can independently use the machine. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard [[headphone jack]] on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the [[Nordea]] and [[Swedbank]] use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad. Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded [[sound]] files or via text-to-speech [[speech synthesis]].



A [[Teller Assist Unit]] may also share many of the same components as an ATM (including a vault), but they are distinct in that they are designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not the general public, they do not integrate directly into interbank networks, and are usually controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.
