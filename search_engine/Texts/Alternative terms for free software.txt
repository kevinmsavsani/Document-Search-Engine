|quote=Stallman hadn't been invited to the first such gathering of "open source" leaders, a "free software summit" held in April...

Each of the terms "free software" and "open source software" has fans and critics. Partly because of the failure to adopt one specific term, other terms have been proposed.  These include "Software Libre" (or libre software), "FLOSS" (Free/Libre/Open Source Software), and "FOSS" (or F/OSS, [[Free and open source software|Free and Open Source Software]]). These terms share almost identical licence criteria and development practices.

== FLOSS ==


Unlike "libre software", which aimed to solve the ambiguity problem, "FLOSS" aimed to avoid taking sides in the debate over whether it was better to say "free software" or to say "open source software".

Proponents of the term point out that parts of the FLOSS acronym can be translated into other languages, with for example the "F" representing ''free'' (English) or ''frei'' (German), and the "L" representing ''libre'' (Spanish or French), ''livre'' (Portuguese), or ''libero'' (Italian), and so on. However, this term is not often used in official, non-English, documents, since the words in these languages for "free as in freedom" do not have the ambiguity problem of English's "free".

All of the terms are used interchangeably, the choice of which to use is mostly political (wanting to support a certain group) or practical (thinking that one term is the clearest).

==Licenses==

The [[Free Software Foundation]] and the [[Open Source Initiative]] each publish lists of licenses that they accept as complying with their definitions of free software and open source software respectively.

*[[List of OSI approved software licenses]]


There is also a class of software that is covered by the names discussed in this article, but which doesn't have a licence: software for which the source code is in the [[public domain]].  The use of such source code, and therefore the executable version, is not restricted by copyright and therefore does not need a [[free software licence]] to make it free software.
