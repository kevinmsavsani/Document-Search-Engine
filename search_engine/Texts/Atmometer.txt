A simple set up may be made by use of a [[porosity|porous]] flat plate-like object (a [[filter paper]], for example) which can draw water from an easily measurable source (a [[graduated cylinder]], for example) via a wick of some sort. As water evaporates from the surface, it tends to draw more water from the source through the wick by [[capillary action]] to replace the water lost by evaporation. By periodic measurements of the quantity of water remaining in the graduated cylinder, a rate of evaporation can be established. Also, using the surface area of the plate, we can establish a rate of evaporation per unit area.
