'''Adobe GoLive''' is an [[HTML editor]] and web site management application from [[Adobe Systems]]. It replaced [[Adobe PageMill]] as Adobe's primary HTML editor.  The latest version of Adobe GoLive is version 9, which is not integrated as part of [[Adobe Creative Suite]] 3.  GoLive was discontinued in April 2008.

'''Adobe GoLive''' originated as '''CyberStudio''', the flagship product of a company named '''GoLive Systems, Inc.''' then based in Hamburg, Germany. Adobe purchased GoLive in 1999 and re-branded the '''GoLive CyberStudio''' product to what is now '''Adobe GoLive'''. The first versions of Dreamweaver and Cyberstudio were released in a similar timeframe. However, [[Dreamweaver]] eventually became the dominant HTML editor in both [[marketshare|market]] and [[mindshare]].


==General description and distinctive aspects==
GoLive incorporates a largely [[modeless]] workflow that relies heavily on [[drag-and-drop]]. Most user interaction is done via a contextual [[Inspector window|inspector]] rather than the modal workflow found in [[Dreamweaver]]. Among its features are a separate editor for tables that supports nesting, and a two-dimensional panel for applying [[CSS]] styles to elements. GoLive supports [[drag-and-drop]] of native [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]] files via what the company calls "Smart Objects", which then automatically guide the user through saving those files in web-supported formats. Updates to the original Photoshop or Illustrator assets are automatically tracked by GoLive. As a web site management tool, GoLive allows users to transfer and publish content directly from within the application, and allows individual files to be excluded from uploading.
