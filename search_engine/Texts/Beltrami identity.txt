satisfies the differential equation

\frac{d}{dx}\left(L-u'\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=0.

In the case that L is the Lagrangian of a Mechanical system, and if L does not depend on x explicitly, which corresponds to a Lagrangian which does not explicitly depend on time, the Beltrami identity states that the Hamiltonian associated to the Lagrangian is a conserved energy.
 
== Proof ==

Define the conjugate momentum p to be the partial derivative of the function L with respect to u'.


The [[Euler-Lagrange equation]] says


or


define the Hamiltonian H to be the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]] of L with respect to u:


Then 


The second and third term cancel, by the definition of p, and the first and fourth terms cancel by the Euler Lagrange equation. This leaves  the Beltrami identity:


which is a special case of [[Noether's theorem]].

== Application ==

In case that ''L'' is independent of ''x'', then the Beltrami identity states that H is constant


This can be used to solve the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]], in the same way that conservation of energy can be used to solve Newton's law of motion. The condition that H is constant is an equation for the first derivative of u, while the original Euler Lagrange equation is an equation for the second derivative of u.

For example, consider the [[Brachistochrone problem]]: find the curve minimizing the integral:


The quantity to minimize is the integral of an L which does not depend explicitly on time,


so the associated Hamiltonian is constant:



which simplifies to the differential equation for the cycloid.
