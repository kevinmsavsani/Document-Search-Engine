The '''ANSI/ISO C Specification Language '''('''ACSL''') is a specification language for [[C program]]s, using Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants, that follows the design by contract paradigm. Specifications are written as C annotation comments to the C program, which hence can be compiled with any C compiler.

The current verification tool for ACSL is [[Frama-C]].

== Overview ==

ACSL is a Behavioral Interface Specification Language (BISL). It aims at specifying behavioral properties of C source code. The main inspiration for this language comes from the specification language of the Caduceus tool for deductive verification of behavioral properties of [[C program]]s. The specification language of Caduceus is itself inspired from [[JML]] which aims at similar goals for Java source code.

One difference with [[JML]], is that ACSL aims at static verification and deductive verification whereas [[JML]] aims both at runtime assertion checking and static verification using for instance the [[ESC/Java]] tool.

== Syntax ==


 /*@ requires \valid(p);
   @ assigns *p;
   @ ensures *p == \old(*p) + 1;
   @*/
 void incrstar (int *p);


== Tool support ==

Most of the features of ACSL are supported by [[Frama-C]].
