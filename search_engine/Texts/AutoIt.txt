With the release of Version 3, the syntax of AutoIt has been restructured to be more like the [[BASIC]] family of languages. It is a [[third-generation programming language]] using a classical data model, utilizing a variant data type that can store several types of data, including arrays. It is compatible with Windows [[Windows 95|95]], [[Windows 98|98]], [[Windows Me|ME]], [[Windows NT4|NT4]], [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows 2003|2003]] and [[Windows Vista|Vista]] (however, support for operating systems older than [[Windows 2000]] was [http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=86590&st=0&entry620851 discontinued with the release of v3.3.0]).


==Features==
[[Image:exampleau3.png|275px|thumb||The AutoIt [[SciTE]] editor.]]
*Scripting language with BASIC-like structure for Windows Desktop Environment.
*Add-on libraries and modules for specific applications.
*On-line support forum for AutoIt users and developers.
*Supports [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] protocols.
*Supports COM ([[component object model]]ling) objects.
*Call functions in [[Microsoft Dynamic Link Library|Win32 DLLs]].
*Run console applications and access the [[standard streams]].
*Include files in the compiled file to be extracted when run.
*[[Graphical User Interface|GUI]] interfaces, create message and input boxes.
*Play sounds, pause, resume, stop, seek, get the current position of the sound and get the length of the sound.
*Simulate [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] movements.
*Manipulate windows and processes.
*Automate sending user input and keystrokes to applications, as well as to individual controls within an application.
*Scripts can be compiled into standalone executables.
*Unicode support from version 3.2.4.0.
*64 bit code support from version 3.2.10.0.
*Supports [[regular expressions]].
*Works with Windows Vista's [[User Account Control]].

==Limitations==
*AutoIt is single [[Thread (computer science)|threaded]] which makes asynchronous programming, concurrency and parallelism (e.g.  communications applications) extremely difficult.
(This can be worked around through the use of such things as multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]], [[Component Object Model]] etc. but it would be much less onerous if a [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] API was provided for in the language itself or its libraries.)
*AutoIt applications are often picked up as a false positive by virus scanners using heuristics as its nature is a self extracting executable

==Usage==
AutoIt can be used to produce [[utility software]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and automate common tasks, such as [[website monitoring]], [[network monitoring]], [[disk defragging]] and [[backup]].  It is also used to simulate [[end-user (computer science)|application users]], whereby an [[application software|application]] is ''driven'' by an AutoIt script in place of manual application control during [[software testing]].

== Examples ==
=== Hello world ===
; Displays "Hello, world!" in a MsgBox and exits.
MsgBox(0, "Title", "Hello, world!")
Exit


=== Find Average ===

;Finds the average of numbers specified by a user.
;The numbers must be delimited by commas.
#NoTrayIcon

$form = GUICreate("Average Finder", 300, 100)

$textbox = GUICtrlCreateInput("", 20, 20, 220)
$label1 = GUICtrlCreateLabel("=", 245, 20, 30, 20)
$ansLabel = GUICtrlCreateLabel("", 255, 20, 50, 20)
$button = GUICtrlCreateButton("Find Average", 100, 40)
