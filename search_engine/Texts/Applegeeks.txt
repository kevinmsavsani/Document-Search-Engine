''Applegeeks'' is largely based around the misadventures of "Hawk," a somewhat delusional college student with an unnatural fondness for [[Apple Computer|Apple]] products; his aspiring writer friend, Jayce; and their friends and cohorts. The comic's format shifts between gag-a-day material to spurts of [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], often dealing with material related to technological accomplishments (with unforeseen results), quasi-romantic unease, or situational comedic moments between the characters. It has currently shifted to a far darker tone with the beginning of the Exodus story arc.



==Plot and recurrent themes==

''Applegeeks''' overall narrative primarily consists of the story of Hawk's creation, Eve. She is constructed from the remains of an Apple [[robot]], which was originally intended by Hawk to make toast, although he gave up this plan after realizing that the robot would merely consume the toast itself. After its subsequent destruction at the hands of [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)#Ethan|Ethan]]'s X-Bot (both main characters from ''[[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|Ctrl+Alt+Del]]'', a popular webcomic), its parts are used to create Eve - a feminine [[android (robot)|android]], or [[gynoid]]. Soon after her introduction and minor development as a character, Eve's personality collapses and she destroys an Apple store. A battle ensues between Hawk and Eve in an attempt to subdue and capture her. While Hawk distracts Eve, Gina plugs her into Hawk's laptop and uploads a virus that shuts her down. Afterward, the inoperative body of Eve is stolen by Frost, due to his jealousy of Hawk's inventive talents. Hawk, Jayce and Gina travel to Japan to rescue Eve and in a climactic confrontation the warehouse where she was held is destroyed in a massive explosion. This begins the Exodus story arc.

Though having an overall narrative of a sort, ''Applegeeks'' additionally has several running subplots that appear frequently throughout the comic. For example, the romance of Jayce Wilder and Alice Fox subplot appears frequently — the two were childhood friends and despite early troubles expressing their feelings, both are currently engaged in dating; Captain Power (of no relation to the [[Captain Power|late 1980's show of the same name]], nor to the toy line), the imagined superhero alter ego of Hawk, who somewhat resembles Stupendous Man from ''[[Calvin & Hobbes]]'', and wears a [[Power symbol]] bandana down over his eyes (or more recently, a ''[[Naruto]]''-style headband with the Apple "power" logo displayed); and Hawk's troubles during [[Ramadan]], usually including hallucinations brought on by hunger, and Jayce tormenting him by eating large amounts of food in front of him. There is also a girl named Ashley who starts a vendetta on Hawk with the assistance of her partner Mistah Bear because he destroyed her tricycle. 

''Applegeeks'' also makes use of several [[running gags]]: the [[Calling shotgun|Shotgun Game]], in which a person calls out "shotgun," but may be challenged for their position in the front seat by another individual, who does so by dropping their pants (but not undergarments), and in turn must respond by dropping ''their'' pants and racing the challenger to the vehicle (this has often made the driver pull away at an extremely hurried pace, even if he or she knows the people with the pants down); the plastic bubble that Hawk is placed in whenever he enters an Apple store, in order to avoid "[http://www.applegeeks.com/comics/viewcomic.php?issue=166 mishaps]"; and numerous references to other webcomics, often including cameo appearances by objects and characters from such webcomics as ''[[Megatokyo]]'' and ''Ctrl+Alt+Del''. For example, the ''Megatokyo'' character Ping appeared in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comics/viewcomic.php?issue=273 strip 273] of ''Applegeeks''. Another example is when they try to rescue Eve and become surrounded by enemies, at which point they call Junpei and a Rent-a-Zilla to aid them.

==Characters==

*'''Jayce Wilder''' is the secondary protagonist and was once shown as general goofball, although compared to Hawk, Jayce's occasional boyish antics seem normal. He has occasionally revealed a personal dark side, which Gina has noticed. He clearly has a strong sense of leadership and can often be the most logical member of the group when the situation requires. He is an avid writer, and has a tendency to get nostalgic from time to time. He has been dating Alice Fox, his childhood friend. His first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=1 comic #1].

*'''Alice Fox''' is the primary female cast member; often the voice of reason. She has been dating Jayce Wilder, having finally moved past the "close friend" stage after several years. Her first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=10 comic #10]. She is clearly the most caring in the group, though she has often shown to be very strong willed when pushed. For a time she and Hawk were at odds in relation to his treatment of Eve, but they have since then grown closer than before.

*'''Gina McQuarrie''' is a female model, strongly independent individual, and known for lack of academic motivation. Alice's best friend. Sometimes has an Irish accent. She also has a bad habit of smoking. Her first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=25 comic #25]. Following the group's trip to Tokyo and the disappearance of Hawk and Eve, Gina took a trip of self-discovery and possible self-destruction where she would compete in fighting tournaments which her parents had once been considered champions of. She has a strong bond and kind of a "free" friendship with Hawk - she helped him save Eve at both occasions, sometimes they both appear naked together and she let Hawk grab her breasts after getting back from her trip.

*'''Eve''' is a [[gynoid]] built with Apple aesthetic design sensibilities in mind. She has an extreme hatred for [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s — although considering that Hawk constructed her, this is not a surprising trait — and incredible physical strength. Recently, she has been kidnapped after being shut down by Hawk and then subsequently rescued. She is conceptualized in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=138 comic #138]. After having disappeared in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=300 comic #300], Eve reappeared in the Exodus saga with Hawk in Japan.

*'''Mr. Squirrely''' is a squirrel with mysterious powers and the ability to communicate with Hawk. Possibly a delusion brought on by Hawk's Ramadan fasting, though there are issues that conflict with this idea.

*'''Frost''' is a supporting cast member who makes the odd appearance and was often the voice of reason when Alice wasn't around. Early on, he disappeared from the comics. He returned in issue 227, however, and may have been responsible for a rash of shotgun-game related murders (however, as the idea of this was Hawk's and Jayce claimed there had not been any strange deaths in the area recently, it is possible that this was simply a gag). Frost then proceeded to steal Eve in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comics/viewcomic.php?issue=250 issue 250].Though he did this under the orders of Jayce's father, he appeared also motivated by jealousy of Hawk's inventive skills. His first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=2 comic #2].

*'''Naku''' was originally a member of ''Applegeeks'', but Naku's real-life inspiration went on to other projects. As such, her character was retired. She was a "tech geek" and attractive gamer girl during her tenure in the comic.


*'''Ashley''' is the world's next great super-villain. Some day. For now, she is the little red-headed terror of a daughter to a single mom. After Hawk, in his Power gear, commandeered her tricycle and returned it as scrap, she swore vengeance. To that end, she and her henchman, Mistah Bear have been formulating a master plan to exact their revenge. After finding out who Hawk was, Ashley has expanded her evil to his friends including Alice.

*'''Old Mac''' is apparently either Hawk's first attempt at building a sentient lifeform from an Apple computer, or an old computer that somehow gained self awareness after a long time in storage. He is an old Compact Macintosh (implied to be the original 1984 model)  that apparently has the voice of Morgan Freeman.

==Artistic directions==

Around [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=35 issue 35], the comic began to develop a more polished look, with brighter highlights and sleeker lines. Onwards from 35, Haque has continued to develop this sleek, shiny appearance in the comic, lending itself to the establishment of such characters as Eve, who, being artificial, requires a slightly sharper, more technological look than the human cast. Also, as the comic progressed, the skin tones of several different characters darkened considerably.

Around [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=200 issue 200], the comic made a dramatic shift in both its artistic style and storytelling, both becoming much "darker" and more mature. Individual strips still contained day-to-day jokes, but the storyline became far more sweeping and epic, in the style of printed comic books. Some of the artistic shift to pseudo-realism can be credited to Haque's interest in American comics, which generally have a grittier, harsher style than the Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] that many webcomics are based on.

At the end of the "Dark Eve Saga" arc ([http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=218 issue 218]), the art style shifted back towards the more cartoon-like visuals, and the more humor-based storyline also returned. It later shifts back into the darker style with Eve's kidnapping and the following Exodus story arc.

After issue 300, the art style in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=301 issue 301] began to reflect the style of comic books that Hawk enjoys.
