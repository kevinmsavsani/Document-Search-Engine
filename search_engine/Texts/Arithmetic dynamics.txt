is a field that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, [[dynamical systems]] and [[number theory]].

''Global arithmetic dynamics'' refers to the study of analogues of classical [[Diophantine equations|Diophantine geometry]]  in the setting of discrete dynamical systems, while ''local arithmetic dynamics'', also called [[p-adic dynamics|p-adic or nonarchimedean dynamics]], is an analogue of classical dynamics in which

The following table describes a rough correspondence between Diophantine equations, especially [[abelian varieties]], and dynamical systems:
{|border=1
|+
! Diophantine equations !! Dynamical systems
|-
| Rational and integer points on a variety
| Rational and integer points in an orbit
|-
| Points of finite order on an abelian variety
| [[periodic point|Preperiodic points]] of a rational function
|}

  F^{(n)} = F \circ F \circ \cdots \circ F.


The point is ''preperiodic'' if

  O_F(P) = \bigl\{ P, F(P), F^{(2)}(P), F^{(3)}(P), F^{(4)}(P), \ldots\bigr\}.

==Integer points in orbits==
The orbit of a rational map may contain infinitely many integers. For
an integer, then it is clear that the entire orbit
consists of integers. Similarly, if
some iterate
in the orbit is an integer. An example of this phenomenon is the map
It turns out that this is the only way that an orbit can contain
infinitely many integers.

and others concerning subvarieties that contain infinitely many periodic
points or that intersect an orbit in infinitely many points. These are
dynamical analogues of, respectively,  the [[Manin-Munford conjecture|Manin&ndash;Mumford conjecture]], proven by Raynaud,
and the [[Faltings' theorem|Mordell&ndash;Lang conjecture]], proven by [[Gerd Faltings|Faltings]].
The following conjectures illustrate the general theory in the case that the subvariety is a curve.

'''Conjecture'''
that either of the following is true:

==Generalizations==
There are natural generalizations of arithmetic dynamics
of other affine or [[projective variety|projective varieties]].

==Other areas in which number theory and dynamics interact==
There are many other problems of a number theoretic nature that appear in the
setting of dynamical systems, including:

* dynamics over [[finite field]]s.
* dynamics on [[Lie group]]s.
* arithmetic properties of dynamically defined [[moduli space]]s.
* dynamics on [[Drinfeld module]]s.
* number-theoretic iteration problems that are not described by rational maps on varieties, for example, the [[Collatz problem]].

The [http://math.brown.edu/~jhs/ADSBIB.pdf Arithmetic Dynamics Reference List] gives an extensive list of articles and books covering a wide
range of arithmetical dynamical topics.
