==History==

==Rules==
There were some main rules for AmiZilla project to be accomplished by those developers who wanted to achieve the full prize bounty. The main rule was the fact that Amizilla should be a porting of any of the Mozilla/Firefox browsers into Amiga platform, and it should be an Open Source project. the code should be made freely available to any Amiga developer, and easily ported (with any obvious obliged differences) to any actually existing Amiga system such as AROS, AmigaOS 3 for [[Motorola]] 680XX family of processors, [[AmigaOS 4]] for PPC family of processors and MorphOS. The project should be realized in C or C++ to grant an easy porting of the code on every platform, and the money had had being divided up to the winning team based on how much work each team member had effectively realized (for example if the anonymous person "Joe Developer" had realized 70% of the coding he had got 70% of the booty). The fact the project had to be multi-platform, and aimed at supporting all the major Amiga operating systems at the same time was the main cause of its lack of success. No any single Amiga developer could had started coding for AmiZilla as a one-man job because the effort to realize a porting of Firefox on all the Amiga systems, it should had been truly an enormous task to be accomplished, and also it was difficult to start a joined team development with various people skilled at the three main Amiga systems due to never dormant grudges that afflicted the Amiga community, that was and still is divided into three main branches (AmigaOS, AROS, MorphOS) and any branch had its loyal supporters.

==Results of the AmiZilla project==
Despite of its apparent lack of success, the AmiZilla Bounty Project inspired many bounty systems that were created upon AmiZilla's example. It lead a great rampage in Amiga for the funding of any software project and help developers to gain a concrete (or even symbolic) amount of money to get a revenue for their efforts in creating or porting software for Amiga platforms. After AmiZilla there were created bounties for AROS, MorphOS and AmigaOS. Almost the whole AROS Operating System was created by hiring bounties, and also there are still ongoing MorphOS Bounty Projects like [http://www.power2people.org/ "Power2People"], or the "Amigabounty.net" for AmigaOS, etc.,etc. The whole Amiga community learned from AmiZilla how to fund the programmers that still work for this computing platform and helping to develop the software that it is needed in Amiga to live on and continue any further software development for this platform.
