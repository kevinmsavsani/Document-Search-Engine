'''Allative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''all'''}}; from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''allāt-'', ''afferre'' "to bring to") is a type of the [[locative case]]s used in several languages. The term '''allative''' is generally used for the [[lative case]] in the majority of languages which do not make finer distinctions.

==Finnish language==
In the [[Finnish language]], the allative is the fifth of the locative [[declension|cases]], with the basic meaning of "onto". Its ending is ''-lle'', for example ''pöytä'' (table) and ''pöydälle'' (onto the top of the table). In addition, it is the logical complement of the [[adessive case]] for referring to "being around the place". For example, ''koululle'' means "to the vicinity of the school". With time, the use is the same: ''ruokatunti'' (lunch break) and ''... lähti ruokatunnille'' ("... left to the lunch break"). Some actions require the case, e.g. ''kävely'' - ''mennä kävelylle'' "a walk - go for a walk".

The other locative cases in Finnish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] are:
*[[Inessive case]] ("in")
*[[Elative case]] ("out of")
*[[Illative case]] ("into")
*[[Adessive case]] ("on")
*[[Ablative case]] ("from off of")

==Baltic languages==
In the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language]]s the allative had been used dialectally as an innovation since the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]], but it is almost out of use in modern times. Its ending in Lithuanian is ''-op'' which was shortened from ''-opi'', whereas its ending in Latvian is ''-up''. In the modern languages the remains of the allative can be found in certain fixed expressions that have become [[adverb]]s, such as '''Lit.''' ''išėjo Dievop'' ("gone to God", i.e. died), ''velniop!'' ("to hell!"), ''nuteisti myriop'' ("[[death sentence|sentence to death]]"), ''rudeniop'' ("towards autumn"), ''vakarop'' ("towards the evening") , '''Lat.''' ''mājup'' ("towards home"), ''kalnup'' ("uphill"), ''lejup'' ("downhill").
